Introduction\\nTechnological support for different types of social activity planning is one of many as-\\npects of human life digitalization. We know many software solutions and smartphone-\\nbased implementation addressing time, budget, or location management, such as\\ncomputer-assisted time, budget, activity or project scheduling [1,2,3,4], event-based so-\\ncial activity planning [5,6], or travel planning [7,8,9,10]. Most practical solutions imple-\\nment the determined scenarios when the constraints and conditions (goals, time, location,\\nactivities, and participants) are known in advance. For example, planning a meeting usu-\\nally assumes setting time and location information, sending confirmations to the involved\\n1Corresponding Author: Evgeny Pyshkin, University of Aizu, Tsuruga Ikki-machi, Aizu-Wakamatsu\\n9658580, Japan; E-mail: pyshe@u-aizu.ac.jp\\nparticipants, etc. There is also a growing interest in developing personalized systems\\nextending user experience based on using social network data and personal user profiles,\\nwhich are often linked to location data as well [11,12,13], for example, in numerous\\nsolutions for travelers [14,15,16,17].\\nHowever, there are frequent situations when the planning parameters can only be\\npartially defined, the perfect timing or exact location are unknown, and the decision\\nframe is rather fuzzy. For example, we know or are observing an interesting location\\nwhich is worth visiting, but could not decide in advance on a suitable time frame for such\\na visit (such as a better season) and a list of possible side activities that would extend a\\nuser’s experience significantly (such as visiting exhibitions or museums).\\nEven for the scenarios of standard meeting schedulers aimed at managing the event\\ntime, meeting rooms, discussion topics, and lists of attendees; there is space for less\\ndecided situations.

Related Studies\\nIn our earlier works, we introduced a concept of soft planning being a metaphor for\\npersonalized situational planning scenarios which are (1) not particularly certain, (2) may\\nbe implemented when some suitable situation takes place (e.g. time and/or locations are\\nnot fixed in advance), and (3) in principle, might not be implemented at all [18,19].\\nPresent-day mobile devices form an ecosystem for the personalization of digital ser-\\nvices they provide. In part, support for different kinds of notifications is one of the key\\nfeatures of present-day smart devices [20]; smart device notifications are no longer just\\nsituational alerts, they become an integral proactive component of mobile services en-\\ngaging with their users [21,22] or enabling them to manage their activity-related choices,\\nfor example, through the check-in mechanisms used in social networks [23]. Such proac-\\ntive services help to overcome the limitations of human decision-making conditioned by\\nthe naturally limited capabilities of individuals to memorize, store or organize informa-\\ntion [24,25]. Notifications give the common approach to link the current context to a sit-\\nuation which might be distant in time or/and location, while this context, in turn, can be\\n“pre-programmed” by the user as a description of a deferred action to be implemented\\nlater.\\n3. “Soft Planning”: Revisiting the Concept\\n3.1. Situational Planning by Examples\\nHere are some model scenarios illustrating the concept of soft planning:\\n1. Someone realizes that some product or household item is missing at home (Fig-\\nure 1). It is not so urgent that one must go to find it immediately. Instead, it might\\nbe helpful to be reminded while the person in charge is in or nearby the particular\\nstores, where this item can be found. Thus, exact time or even location might be\\nunknown.\\nFigure 1. Soft planning in shopping.\\n2. A traveler discovers an interesting sightseeing spot which is worth visiting at a\\nlater date (Figure 2). Thus, the exact time frame for a visit might be unknown,\\nbut a reminder could be helpful to describe a kind of deferred activity that can be\\nsuggested as soon as it happens that the traveler is nearby this location again (for\\nexample, driving in the area because of some business) but in a better season.\\nFigure 2. Soft planning while travelling.\\n3. A theatre or cinema lover would like to watch a particular performance (maybe\\nstill unreleased) as soon as it becomes available for watching or booking.\\n4. A householder needs to do some housework, where specific timing is unknown or\\nnot so important. The reminders could be helpful but only while being at home.\\n3.2. Conceptualization\\nIt is commonly agreed that conceptualization is an important process, which often\\ninvolves ontology-based approaches for system design and requirement engineering\\nstages [26,27,28]. Constructing an ontology model helps in eliminating redundant infor-\\nmation and defining project scope better. As a conceptual core of the whole project, the\\ncommon-sense ontology is linked to domain-specific ontologies and provides grounds\\nFigure 3. Iterations in model conceptualization.\\nfor requirement elicitation. Software prototyping helps us to refine the requirements and\\nrevisit the ontology models as well, and improve our understanding of the system scope\\nand boundaries (Figure 3).\\nFigure 4. Soft planning system: common-sense ontology (revised against [18]).\\nFigure 4 illustrates the conceptual model of soft planning through constructing a\\ncommon-sense ontology. The user’s activity, situation, and ideas influence the plan,\\nwhere the user is involved in the activity, and the activity is contextualized by the situa-\\ntion and suggested by the system. The user defines the desired reminders through condi-\\ntions or properties. The common-sense ontology can be naturally connected to the sub-\\nject domain ontology (such as one in Figure 5) providing grounds to discover major\\nentities to be modeled in the system and their key relationships.\\nThe condition of the reminder in this system is mainly determined by the time and\\nlocation. The location consists of a current location and a programmed location, the\\nlatter being the location generated by the system. According to the suggested model, the\\nreminders set by the user are assumed to belong to the following major classes:\\nFigure 5. Domain-specific entities.\\n1. Active reminders are to be configured by the user and processed by the system so\\nthat when the appropriate user conditions (such as being near the desired loca-\\ntion) are fulfilled, the system issues a notification.\\n2. Templates are reminder configurations stored in the system for future use to fa-\\ncilitate the future notification setup. The templates are assumed to be configured\\npartially, or suggested by the system for common or frequent scenarios.\\n3. Suspended reminders are those delayed by the user. For suspended reminders, the\\nuser may need specific configuration options referring to the earlier established\\npolicies (such as reactivate the reminder after a certain period of time, reactivate\\nit manually, or even notify the user about the existing suspended actions).\\n4. Archived reminders may be useful for the cases if the user wishes to save the\\npreviously configured reminders for future reactivation instead of trashing them.\\n3.3. Major Use Cases\\nFigure 6 shows the major scenarios to be supported by this system.\\n3.4. Reminders and Notifications: Workflow\\nBased on reminder status definitions, we defined two major stages of reminder setting\\nand notification management presented in Figures 7– 8 using the statechart behavioral\\nmodels based on Harel’s statechart formalism [29].\\nFigure 6. Major use cases in the soft planning system.\\nFigure 7 drafts the superstate Setting and configuring a reminder describing major\\nevents and actions to create a reminder, manage the lists of active and archived reminders,\\nsave, or delete reminders.\\nFigure 8 sketches the superstate Working with issued notifications supporting such\\ntransactions as “forgetting” the reminder, archiving it, keeping it active, or re-configuring\\nit (thus, triggering the system back to the superstate Setting and configuring a reminder).\\n4. Piloting Prototypes: Lessons Learned\\nTo improve our understanding of the project goals and challenges to resolve, we experi-\\nmented with several prototype implementations developed as Android applications. Ex-\\nperimental components partially address the use cases presented in Figure 6. This section\\ndescribes the lessons learned as a result of experiments with developed prototypes.\\n4.1. Geofencing in the Context of Soft Planning\\nThe trickiest problem of situational planning scenario implementation is to assure that\\nrelevant notifications are issued in connection to specific locations. To achieve this,\\nlocation-based services such as geofences are required. Geofences define virtual geo-\\ngraphic boundaries (usually connected to some point of interest) and enable registered\\napplications to trigger responses when a mobile device enters or leaves a particular area\\n(see, for example, [30]). Geofences can be set with geographic coordinates, geometric\\nFigure 7. Setting a reminder.\\nFigure 8. Working with issued notifications.\\nparameters (such as radius for circular geofences), duration, and transition types. They\\nare often connected with the points of vision while constructing traveling itineraries\\nand tourist guides [31]. Figure 9 illustrates the main scenario and the main eventual\\nissue: using the geometry-based distancing to decide on notification upon entering the\\ngeofence area might lead to annoying and unreliable notifications or never-ending re-\\nminders. Therefore, it is important to elicit a number of aspects to be taken into the\\nconsideration while implementing a practical location-based notification service:\\n1. Recommendations and proximity evaluation may differ significantly depending\\non the means of transportation.\\n2. Landscape characteristics (especially while walking or cycling may affect user’s\\nwish to proceed with the suggested deferred activity.\\nFigure 9. Location-based scenario: planning → geofencing → action.\\n3. Possible waiting time or preliminary booking required at the recommended loca-\\ntion could make a suggestion hard to follow.\\n4. Using programmed reminders together with a reasoning engine may be helpful\\nfor getting some more information about “softly” planned activities referring to a\\nselection of possible locations rather than to a specific one (like “any food store”\\nbut not a particular one).\\n5. Conversion of a reminded activity to a regular plan to be included in the calendar\\nor time scheduler might need integration with popular time management services.\\nWe used a combination of system alarms, calendars, and notifications for point-in-\\ntime and time-period reminders; and added voice input and cloud sync to make it easier\\nto use. For location-based reminders, we used a combination of Google’s geofence and\\ncloud services to synchronize the geofence coordinates created in the database with the\\ncloud. The system can send the corresponding notification when the user enters or leave\\nthe registered geofence. It is helpful for further debugging and evaluation.\\n4.2. Third-Party Services\\nThe following third-party services are shown to be helpful for developing a prototype\\nimplementation:\\n1. iFLYTEK Speech Recognition – The component is used to recognize short audio\\nand convert into text in real time [32], thus, supporting voice input.\\n2. Google Geofence – Geofencing combines awareness of the user’s current location\\nwith awareness of the user’s proximity to locations that may be of interest[33]. It\\nis used for creating location-based notifications.\\n3. Nutstore WebDav – Using WebDav and Firebase[34] helps in backing-up the\\nconfigured reminder information to ensure that users can change or use it multi-\\nple devices supporting such options as direct online editing, version control, and\\ncollaborative editing[35]. The data synchronize component uses a cloud service\\nthat supports WebDav protocol. The advantage of such an architecture is that the\\ndeveloper does not need to develop a separate server-side program. However, the\\nuser needs to be registered with the cloud service provider.\\n4.3. Client Environment\\nThe proof-of-concept client applications running under Android 10.0 run-time environ-\\nment were developed using Java and Kotlin.\\n5. Conclusion and Future Work\\nThe scenarios of soft planning may be considered as an element of activity-centric com-\\nputing paradigm addressing the multi-faceted nature of human activity in the real world,\\nwhen people tend to create “activity representations that are simple, yet flexible enough\\nto accommodate different levels of rigidity” [36] and “re-program” their future experi-\\nence based on the feedback they may have from the current activity, or from the experi-\\nence of other users.\\nThere is a number of issues requiring further efforts to move the project towards its\\npractical use:\\n• Identification of possible useful scenarios of user collaboration in setting and using\\n“soft” plans;\\n• Integration of soft planners with regular time schedulers and activity organizers;\\n• Possibilities to apply knowledge-based recommendation and NLP algorithms so\\nthat to identify and suggest the suitable scenario to the user semi-automatically.\\nThough the current stage of the project does not involve sufficient arguable experi-\\nmental results to contrast the approach against the existing human-centric solutions (usu-\\nally actively involving machine learning algorithms), we believe that the presented con-\\nceptualization creates grounds for improving personalized services and environments for\\npractical ubiquitous time and activity management.\\n\\n\\n\",\n"," 'Download\\n\\nSource\\n\\nPDF\\nActions\\n   Copy Project\\n   Word Count\\nSync\\n   Dropbox\\n   Git\\n   GitHub\\nSettings\\nCompiler\\n\\nTrack changes is on\\nTowards Demystifying Transformations of Tchaikovsky’s Children’s Album with\\nSupport of Computational Models: Problem Conceptualization\\n\\n\\nAbstract—Though the studies of rich metaphors hidden in the\\nmusical compositions lay mostly in scope of art and musicology,\\nthere is still large space for formal methods based on mathe-\\nmatical models and computer technology that can be helpful in\\ndiscovering complementary insights to how the composition is\\nstructured, what are its relationships to the precursors’ works,\\nand how it affects the later works of the same or other authors.\\nOur idea is to investigate how computational models can enhance\\nmusicology research on music style identification and comparative\\nanalysis using the case study of Tchaikovsky’s Children’s Album.\\nKeywords–Musicology; music information retrieval; human-\\ncentric computing; similarity; music modeling.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nIn my recent talk on Jan 6th, 2021, in the University of\\nAizu “Tchaikovsky. Children’s (?) Album: Time, Metaphors,\\nRediscoveries” [1], I discussed the phenomenon of Piotr\\nTchaikovsky’s “Children’s Album” for piano solo (Op. 39) [2].\\nThis masterpiece was composed and published as far as in\\n1878, but today it still remains one of constant topics of interest\\nfor researchers [3], [4]. Though the study of rich metaphors\\nhidden in the pieces thought to be for children rather lies in the\\nscope of art and musicology, there is still a large research space\\nfor formal methods based on mathematical and computational\\nmodels, which may give additional insights into our under-\\nstanding of the structure and organization of the whole work,\\nits relationships to precursors such as “43 Clavierst ̈ucke f ̈ur die\\nJugend” by Robert Schumann [5], as well as the reasons for\\nsignificant differences between the original manuscript and the\\nfirst published edition. Surprisingly, in musicology literature,\\none of the first careful studies of transformations between\\nthe manuscript and the published edition can be found in the\\nearly 1990s only; thus, more than 100 years after the whole\\nwork was completed [6], [7]. These studies mostly remain in\\nscope of music and art theory, with almost no involvement\\nof machine learning approaches. Today, it is commonly not\\ndisputed that computer science and artificial intelligence may\\ncontribute to musicology research on music style identification\\nand comparative analysis. In this study we try to discover\\nappropriate formal models that would enhance the analysis and\\nunderstanding of Tchaikovsky’s “Children’s Album”, which\\ncan be considered as a very good example of applied human-\\ncentric computing research in the frame of art and humanities,\\nwhere solutions cannot be designed within a certain context\\nonly, but require intensive cross-disciplinary efforts so as to\\nbridge the communities working in different contexts and using\\ndifferent vocabularies [8].\\nII. RELATED WORK\\nAccording to Nattiez, music is a symbolic fact charac-\\nterized by the complex configuration of interpretants [9]. In\\nmusic, we use various connected but independent models\\nincluding letter-based notations such as Helmholz or scientific\\npitch notation (that can be considered as simple syntax based\\nlanguage constructions), complex symbolic notations in the\\nform of graphic note scores ranging from hardly formalizable\\nancient models such as Znamenny chant, at one pole, or\\nrelatively strict Mensural notation, at another pole, up to\\nmodern sheet music (based on many rules but giving some\\nfreedom to support the individual styles of composers), piano\\nroll notation, tablature, MIDI representations, as well as audio\\nsignals and even spectral models such as acoustic fingerprints.\\nThe great variety of models used for music representation is\\none of reasons why music provides an interesting and complex\\nuse case for experimenting with information retrieval, object\\nrecognition and classification algorithms. Music representation\\ncomplexity can be explained by the presence of two arrays of\\nelements and relationships, where the first one corresponds\\nto the elements that can be treated mathematically (such as\\npitch, rhythm, or harmony), while the second one includes\\nnon-mathematical elements such as tension, expectancy, and\\nemotion [10].\\nA.

From this\\npoint of view, models of functional representation of music\\nharmony and harmonic similarity estimation [13] seem to be\\nmore adequate to the problem of style identification. Indeed,\\nusually, listeners can recognize similarity of compositions\\nbecause of their harmonic similarity (see Figure 1).

Renditions and Implications of “Children’s Album”\\nSince both Tchaikovsky and Schumann belong to the ro-\\nmantic tradition rooted in part of leitmotif music by Beethoven\\nand Wagner, on the one hand, and in the new music language of\\nGlinka, Chopin and Liszt, on the other hand, certain harmony\\nand music development similarity surely exists in their works.\\nAccording to the network of influences on classical composers\\noriginally described by Smith and Georges et al. in the original\\nClassical Music Navigator [21], Schumann is one of composers\\nwho greatly influenced Tchaikovsky (along with Balakirev,\\nBeethoven, Chopin, Delibes and others) as shown in Figure 4,\\nHowever, admitting Schumann’s influence to Tchaikovsky\\ndoes not lead us to automatically judge the “Children’s Album”\\nas an imitation of Schumann’s pieces for the young (also with\\nlong history of editions but rather few scholarly studies [23])\\neven though Tchaikovsky claimed it explicitly in the subtitle\\nfor the published edition “24 simple pieces for children like\\nSchumann” (but not in the manuscript! [24]. What if this\\nsubtle (?) subtitle is a kind of hint that Tchaikovsky gave\\nus?

This opinion supports an existing hypothesis\\nclaiming that Tchaikovsky probably preferred to hide some\\nmetaphors so that they are not so explicitly exposed as in the\\nmanuscript.

One of the possible approaches to reducing energy consumption is to increase the ambient temperature, thus lowering the energy consumed in the cooling systems. However, it puts forward more stringent requirements for the reliability and durability of the equipped optoelectronic components. Herein, we fabricate and demonstrate silicon-polymer hybrid (SPH) modulators which feature excellent reliability with an exceptional signal fidelity retained at extremely-high ambient temperatures up to 110 °C and even after a long-period exposure to high temperatures, and meanwhile support ultra-fast single-lane data rates up to 200 gigabits per second. This is achieved by taking advantage of the high electro-optic (EO) activities (in-device n3r33=1021 pm V-1), low dielectric constant, low propagation loss (α, 0.22 dB/mm) and ultra-high glass transition temperature (Tg, 172 °C) of the developed side-chain EO polymers. The presented SPH modulator simultaneously fulfils the requirements on the bandwidth, EO efficiency, and thermal stability for EO modulators. It could provide ultra-fast and reliable interconnects for energy-hungry and harsh-environment applications such as data communication, 5G, autonomous driving, LiDAR, and aviation spacecraft systems, effectively addressing the energy consumption issue for the next-generation optical communication networks. \\n\\nMain\\nRecently, the traffic in data communication has seen explosive growth due to the emergence of bandwidth-hungry applications such as high-definition streaming media, 5G, cloud-based service delivery, and Internet-of-Things. The rapid growth in datacentre’s count and power density is leading to a dramatic increase in demand for energy. It is predicted that by 2025, datacentres will be accountable for 20% of worldwide electricity consumption [1, 2]. The cooling system alone may account for up to 40% in average of the energy demands of a datacentre [3]. Therefore, to increase energy efficiency in datacentres, one effective solution is to raise the operating temperature, thus lowering the energy consumption in the cooling systems. 4% operating costs could be saved from cooling for every 1 °C increase in operating temperature [4]. However, this puts forward higher requirements for the reliability and long-term stability of the components equipped in the datacentres, especially transceivers, at high ambient temperatures. As one of the key components in the transceiver, electro-optic (EO) modulators have been realized on several photonic platforms, such as silicon [5-8], indium phosphide [9-11], organic [12-16], lithium niobate [17-22], and plasmonics [23-29], each with their own advantages, such as enabling the integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, low drive voltages, ultra-high bandwidths up to the terahertz regime [22-24], and small footprints. Considering the ever-increasing energy consumption and emerging applications in harsh environments, apart from the aforementioned aspects, the reliability of the EO modulator at high ambient temperatures is another important aspect to be investigated. Recently, several directly-modulated quantum-dot lasers [30] and distributed feedback (DFB) [31-32] have been successfully demonstrated by operating at an elevated temperature up to 80 °C with data modulations at 25 Gbaud and 53 Gbaud, respectively. On the other hand, external EO modulators incorporating organic EO materials such as silicon-polymer hybrid (SPH),silicon-organic hybrid (SOH), and plasmonic-organic hybrid (POH) modulators have shown outstanding thermal reliability owing to the intrinsic high glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the deployed organic EO materials [25, 29, 33-36]. We have recently reported a thermally-stable EO polymer modulator demonstrating stable performance of its static parameter (V\\uf070) at elevated ambient temperatures up to 105 °C for 2,000 hours [33]. Thereafter, we have further optimized the shape, the nonlinearity, and the Tg of the EO polymer using advanced molecular engineering, and improved the electronic and photonic circuits, especially the electrode design. Herein, we demonstrate a high-temperature-resistant ultra-high-speed SPH modulator, showing an extremely-high bearable ambient temperature up to 110 °C with maintained high-speed signal fidelity, meanwhile ensuring high EO activities (in-device EO figure of merit: n3r33=1021 pm V-1 at 1.55 \\uf06dm, where n is the refractive index and r33 the in-device EO coefficient), and achieving up to 200 Gbit s-1 aggregate data rates, specifically, up to 120 Gbit s-1 with on-off keying (OOK) and up to 200 Gbit s-1 with 4-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM4). Furthermore, the excellent signal fidelity at 100 Gbit s-1 is also experimentally confirmed even after a long-period (100 hours) exposure to 90 °C, thus validating the long-term thermal stability of the modulator. No energy-consuming temperature stabilization unit is deployed in the system. The simultaneous fulfilments of high thermal stability and ultra-high speed signalling make technological inroads into energy-efficient and high-throughput datacentres. In addition, it can also be used to implement reliable and ultra-fast interconnects in harsh-environment applications. \\n\\nResults\\nSilicon-polymer hybrid (SPH) modulator. To fabricate the SPH modulator, we prepare side-chain EO polymers with an ultra-high Tg of up to 172 °C, which are synthesized according to a modified procedure based on [37]. As shown in Fig. 1a, a chromophore with high-molecular hyper-polarizability is attached to the polymer backbone with a high loading density to realize the second-order nonlinear effect, i.e. Pockels effect, and provide a high EO coefficient, thus enabling efficient EO modulations. Meanwhile, the bulky adamantyl unit branched in the acrylate polymer leads to a high Tg. Since the thermal relaxation of acentric chromophore order in the poled film is negligible as long as the storage temperature is well below the Tg, the EO polymers with high Tg could offer good thermal stability. In the polymer synthesis, the loading densities of the chromophore and adamantyl can be simply adjusted, resulting in EO polymers with different Tg and EO efficiencies. A Tg of EO polymers up to 172 °C is obtained with the loading density of adamantyl at 34 wt%, while the loading density of chromophore of around 37 wt% leads to an effective in-device EO figure of merit (n3r33) of around 1021 pm V-1 at a wavelength of 1.55 \\uf06dm (Supplementary Note 2). Moreover, to further enhance the thermal stability of the EO polymer, dialysis purification is performed to remove polymers with low molecular weights. In contrast, the conventional EO polymers are prepared by mixing EO chromophores in the polymer hosts. However, such guest-host polymers could not sufficiently meet the demands for industrial applications due to incomplete thermal reversibility with molecular disordering at elevated temperatures. \\nThe synthesized EO polymer is then used to fabricate the SPH modulator, which is fabricated in a travelling-wave Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration, consisting of ultra-thin silicon core, side-chain polymer, sol-gel SiO2 claddings and electrodes. Figure 1b illustrates the schematic structure of the fabricated SPH layer by layer. The MZI waveguide is patterned on a 40 nm-thick silicon layer. The strip waveguide consists of two Y-junctions which split and combine the optical power, and two 8 mm-long arms with a 200 μm spacing. As illustrated in the schematic of the cross section of the hybrid waveguide (Fig. 1c), a 1 µm-thick EO polymer layer is structured to be sandwiched between two cladding layers prepared from the sol-gel SiO2 resin. A top view photograph of the fabricated SPH modulator is presented in Fig. 1d with a close-up micrograph of the electrodes of the device. On the top of the device, microwave strip-line gold (Au) electrodes with a length of 8 mm are deposited on the MZI arms. To achieve a large EO bandwidth, the electrodes are operated in a travelling wave manner and optimized for impedance matching (Supplementary Note 3). Here, the thickness and width of the electrodes are designed to be 3 μm and 16 μm, respectively. More importantly, in contrast to crystalline and amorphous material modulators, the intrinsic low dielectric constant of the EO polymer results in comparable refractive indices of the microwave and light signals, thus leading to negligible velocity mismatching between them to enable high-speed and broadband operations of the device. According to the measured frequency response of the fabricated SPH modulator shown in Fig. 1f, although the analyser has a limited frequency bandwidth (see Method), a 3-dB bandwidth of 68 GHz is observed while the 6-dB bandwidth of the device is presumed to be over 70 GHz. \\nTo ensure a high EO efficiency, in addition to the optimization of the material’s EO coefficient, the light should be well confined between silicon and polymer layers. Figure 1e shows the calculated field distribution of the TM0 mode. Given that the refractive indices of the polymer and silicon are 1.67 and 3.48, respectively, according to the modal calculation (Supplementary Note 1), the confinement factor (\\uf047) defined by the ratio of the optical power in the EO polymer to the total power is 73.8% with a 4 µm-wide and 40 nm-thick ultra-thin silicon core, which is higher than conventional silicon on insulator (SOI) strip waveguides with typical geometrical dimensions , e.g. \\uf047≈15 % with a 220\\uf0b4500 nm silicon core [38]. With such a large confinement factor in the modulator, the induced refractive-index change in the EO polymer cladding, which is proportional to the applied electrical field, results in a corresponding change of mode field distribution, and consequently accomplishes effective modulations of the guided light. The advantage of the intrinsic high EO coefficient of the polymer, together with the excellent confinement of light in the waveguide, enables a high EO efficiency, leading to a measured \\uf070-voltage-length product (V\\uf070∙L) of 1.44 V∙cm at a wavelength of 1.55 \\uf06dm. In addition, in such a shallow silicon strip [39-41], the fundamental optical mode near the sidewall occupies a small fraction of the total available optical power, thus leading to a propagation loss as low as 0.22 dB/mm (Supplementary Note 5). \\n\\nUp to 200 Gbit s-1 signalling. As mentioned above, the optimizations of the electronic circuit such as electrode dimensions, impedance matching, minimization of frequency-dependent RF propagation loss and coupling loss, together with the intrinsic low dielectric constant of EO polymer, lead to a measured 3 dB bandwidth of around 68 GHz, showing the possibility for beyond 100 Gbit s-1 data operation. The bandwidth expansion is expected by further optimizing the travelling-wave electrode design and fabrication. Using binary driving electronics, OOK signals at bit rates up to 120 Gbit s-1 are generated. The measured optical eye diagrams of 100 Gbit s-1 and 120 Gbit s-1 OOKs are shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, respectively, with clear eye openings. The corresponding bit-error rates (BERs) at operating rates of 90, 100 and 110 Gbit s-1 are presented in Fig. 2e when the received optical power (ROP) before the photo-detector is adjusted. No error floor is observed even for 110 Gbit s-1 OOK till BER of 10-5, which is well below the pre-KP4-FEC BER threshold (2.2\\uf0b410-4). As presumed in the bandwidth analysis, error-free operations are achieved at bit rates beyond 100 Gbit s-1, validating the high-speed operating capacity of the device.\\nMultilevel modulation is another effective method to increase the operating rate of the modulator. As shown in Fig. 3a, for PAM4 signalling, a four-level electrical signal from an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), used as a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), at a sampling rate of 92 GSa s-1 is deployed to drive the SPH modulator. Optical PAM4 signals at symbol rates varying from 44 Gbaud to 56 Gbaud are generated, achieving operating rates up to 112 Gbit s-1. Clear eye diagrams of the obtained 104 Gbit s-1 and 112 Gbit s-1 PAM4 signals are shown in Fig. 3b and 3c, respectively. The measured BER curves of synthesized 88, 104 and 112 Gbit s-1 as functions of ROPs are depicted in Fig. 3d. No error floors are observed up to BER of 1\\uf0b410-5 for all the measured BER curves at bit rates up to 112 Gbit s-1. Instead of conventional non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pulse shape, Nyquist pulse shaping with a small roll-off factor (0.01) could be helpful to further boost the signalling speed of the device with enhanced spectral efficiency. By applying raised cosine filters over the driving electrical signals, through another DAC operated at 120 GSa s-1, Nyquist PAM4 signalling at 80, 92 and 100 Gbaud are realized by the SPH, achieving operating rates of 160, 184 and 200 Gbit s-1, respectively. The obtained eye diagrams at 184 Gbit s-1 and 200 Gbit s-1 are shown in Fig. 3e and 3f, respectively. According to the measured BER curves illustrated in Fig. 3g, the error rates below both the pre-HD-FEC (3.8\\uf0b410-3) and pre-KP4-FEC BER thresholds are well achieved for both 160 Gbit s-1 and 184 Gbit s-1 Nyquist PAM4. On the other hand, for the synthesized 200 Gbit s-1 Nyquist PAM4, the error rates below the pre-HD-FEC threshold are also observed. The successful syntheses of beyond 100 Gbit s-1 (up to 200 Gbit s-1) signals in either OOK or PAM4 verify the ultra-fast operating capacity of the fabricated SPH modulator. \\n\\nHigh-speed operation at elevated temperature. In addition to ultra-fast signalling, the deployment of high-Tg EO polymer in the SPH modulator allows for high-temperature operation without failure, which is essential for improving the datacentres’ energy efficiency by raising the ambient temperature, and crucial for providing components suitable for harsh environments in 5G [42], LiDAR, satellites, and avionics applications. We have tested the long-term thermal reliability and stability of the device in accordance with Telcordia standards of high-temperature storage. It has been confirmed that the static electro-optic characteristic (V\\uf070) of our EO polymer modulator converges to a constant long-term stable value over a long duration (2,000 hours) at elevated temperatures of 85 °C and 105 °C [33].\\nIn order to further comprehensively assess the high-temperature reliability of SPH modulators, instead of monitoring static parameters of the device such as V\\uf070, optical insertion loss, and S parameters, it would be more effective to measure dynamic properties like BER or Q factor of the signals synthesized from the device during or after the exposure to elevated ambient temperatures. In contrast to previous investigations, for the first time to our knowledge, the thermal reliability of the fabricated SPH modulator is assessed by investigating its high-speed performance when the operating ambient temperature is adjusted over an extraordinary wide range (25 °C ~110 °C). For the test, our modulator is first configured as a binary OOK transmitter by feeding binary driving electrical signals at bit rates of 56, 100 and 110 Gbit s-1. The corresponding Q factors of the synthesized OOK signals are measured and shown in Fig. 4a when the ambient temperature is adjusted over the aforementioned range. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, clear eye openings are observed at 56 Gbit s-1 and 100 Gbit s-1 even at extremely-high temperatures up to 105 °C. When the ambient temperature is increased from 25 °C to 110 °C, 56 Gbit s-1 OOK shows less than 0.5 dB decrease in the measured Q factor. The measured Q factors of 100 Gbit s-1 and 110 Gbit s-1 OOK signals decrease slightly (~1 dB) when the ambient temperature is increased till 100 °C. Although higher bit-rate signalling becomes more sensitive to ambient temperatures, the change of Q factor within the wide temperature range is less than 2.5 dB for both 100 Gbit s-1 and 110 Gbit s-1 signals. The measured Q factors over the wide temperature range are all above 3.51, corresponding to the KP4 pre-FEC BER threshold. No abrupt Q factor degradations are observed even for OOKs operating at 100 Gbit s-1 and beyond. As presented in the next section, a negligible penalty is observed once the device is cooled down to room temperature even after a long-period high-temperature (90 °C) exposure, which is in line with previous investigations [33]. In addition, the thermal reliability of the SPH modulator is also investigated when the device is operating at 200 G bit s-1 with PAM4. The BERs of the synthesized 200 G bit s-1 PAM4 are measured over the aforementioned ambient temperature range and plotted in Fig. 4b, only showing a slight increase of less than one order of magnitude. These results indicate the excellent thermal reliability of the SPH modulator at the extremely high temperature, which is attributed to the stable ordering of the chromophore in the synthesized ultra-high-Tg EO polymer. More importantly, the high EO activities of the SPH modulator are well retained over an extraordinary wide temperature range, which enables up to 200 Gbit s-1 high-speed operating even at extremely-high ambient temperatures up to 110 °C. \\n\\nHigh-speed operation after long-period high-temperature storage. As for the organic electro-optic material integrated in SPH devices, de-poling (molecular disordering) usually occurs around less than 30 °C below the glass transition temperature [43, 44], implying that the upper temperature limit for long-term stable operation of the side-chain polymer used in our SPH device (Tg: 172 °C) is ~140 °C. To validate the high-speed functionality of the SPH modulator even after a burn-in high-temperature test, the BER performance of the generated 100 Gbit s-1 signals is evaluated after a 100-hour exposure to a high temperature (90 °C). For comparison, the measured curve of BER versus the ROP before the burn-in test is measured and plotted as well. As shown in Fig. 5a, error-free operations are confirmed for 100 Gbit s-1 signals before and after the burn-in test with BER up to 1\\uf0b410-5, which is below the KP4 pre-FEC BER threshold. With respect to the BER curve before the burn-in test, negligible power penalty is observed even after the 100-hour exposure to high temperature, which is consistent with the observed negligible degradation of V\\uf070 after a period of high-temperature storage [33]. Clear eye openings are observed in the measured eye diagrams in both cases, shown in Fig. 5b and 5c, respectively. The results indicate that the high EO activities could be well maintained even after being stored at elevated temperatures for a long period, demonstrating an excellent long-term thermal stability of the fabricated broadband SPH modulator. \\n\\nThermal reliability comparison. Electro-optic modulators are mainly formed on structures like micro-ring resonator (MRR), Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), or a combination of MRR and MZI. MRR exhibits a compact footprint but shows a strong sensitivity to ambient temperature fluctuations especially on a high thermo-optic (TO) coefficient substrate such as silicon. Most of the proposed approaches to overcome the thermal instability issue in MRR either require significant power consumption in the temperature stabilization unit [45, 46] or incorporate negative TO coefficient materials at the cost of increased complexity [47-49]. Through the active compensation approach, athermal silicon MRR modulators with a good thermal tolerance against 15 K [45] or 7.5 °C [46] thermal drift have been successfully demonstrated. In contrast, MZI and MRR-assisted MZI [50] structures possess better thermal stability. These structures have been demonstrated on various photonic platforms such as SOI, lithium niobate, indium phosphide (InP), SOH, plasmonic-organic hybrid (POH), and SPH. Table 1 lists and compares some modulator metrics of our device with prior demonstrations, focusing on the operating speed and the operating temperature range when the devices are high-speed activated. Note that, for the POH [25, 29] and InP [10] modulators, the high-temperature reliability is evaluated by monitoring the static properties of the devices at a single frequency such as V\\uf070, modulation index or efficiency, rather than evaluating the high-speed signal quality from the devices. To compare the EO activity of these devices across different photonic platforms, herein a voltage-bandwidth parameter is defined by the ratio of the measured 3 dB bandwidth over the half-wave voltage of the device, which is also known as bandwidth half-wave voltage ratio (BVR). A larger BVR indicates a high-speed operating ability with a low driving voltage, corresponding to higher EO activity and efficiency. As shown in Table 1, our device shows the highest EO activity (BVR: 38 GHz V-1). As another important figure of merit for electro-optic modulators, loss-efficiency product is quantified by the multiplication of π-voltage-length product (V\\uf070∙L) and the propagation loss (α), i.e. α∙V\\uf070∙L. In comparison to other devices in Table 1, although the SPH modulator presented in this work has no clear advantage in terms of the footprint, it features the best loss-efficiency product (3.6 V∙dB), indicating an excellent trade-off between optical loss and modulation efficiency. More importantly, it is the only one achieving up to 200 Gbit s-1 operations under an extraordinary wide temperature range (25 °C ~110 °C). The fabricated EO polymer modulator on a silicon substrate represents a new paradigm in EO modulator development for ensuring excellent high-temperature reliability and up to 200 Gbit s-1 ultra-high-speed operations. It simultaneously meets the requirements for both the operating speed and thermal reliability of optoelectronic components in future energy-efficient datacentres and harsh-environment applications. \\n\\n\\n\\nDiscussion. The power dissipation of the modulator driver accounts for the great portion of the overall energy consumption of the transceivers in the datacentres. In the experiments, with the device length of 8 mm, up to 200 Gbit s-1 signalling is performed using the fabricated SPH modulator with a drive voltage of around 1.3 Vpp which is compatible with CMOS voltage levels. The corresponding electrical energy dissipation of the modulator is 42 fJ bit-1 (see Methods). Further optimization of the loss of the microwave strip lines and the improvement of the poling efficiency could further improve the EO efficiency of the modulator, thus reducing V\\uf070, lowering the device energy consumption and facilitating the integration with CMOS circuits. \\nTo improve the energy efficiency of the datacentres, in addition to decreasing the energy consumption in the transceivers, another effective approach is to raise the ambient temperature of the datacenters, thus reducing the energy consumed in the cooling systems. In this work, our fabricated SPH modulator allows for beyond 100 Gbit s-1 high-speed signalling with excellent signal fidelity at an extremely-high ambient temperature of 110 °C, and shows negligible power penalty even after undergoing thermal exposure up to 90 °C for 100 hours, owing to the fast response, high EO activity, and ultra-high thermal reliability (Tg=172 °C) of the deployed EO side-chain polymer. The reliable and durable SPH modulator allows for raising the ambient operating temperature in datacentres, thus saving the running cost and improving energy efficiency. It could also provide EO components suitable for applications in harsh environments. For example, 5G devices are usually installed in aggressive environments (uncontrolled locations) such as on streetlamps, traffic lights, rooftops, stadiums, and parking garages, where the devices are subject to high temperatures and thermal shocks. Even in such aggressive environments, our thermal-reliable EO modulator could provide an effective solution to ensure high throughput and reliable network connections.\\n\\nFuture work. The successful demonstration of the high-temperature-resistant SPH modulator operating at up to 200 Gbit s-1 relies on a combination of effective waveguide structure and highly efficient nonlinear organic EO material. The presented modulator is fabricated on an ultra-thin silicon strip waveguide, featuring ease of fabrication and low propagation loss [39-40]. However, these features come at the cost of millimeter dimensions. In contrast, with device architectures based on a silicon slot waveguide [34, 35, 51, 52] or a metal-insulator-metal plasmonic slot waveguide [23-28] which are deployed in SOH and POH modulators, both optical and electrical fields could be tightly confined into nanoscopic dimensions with enhanced nonlinearities and concentrated electrical field, thereby reducing the \\uf070-voltage-length product in electro-optic modulators, and shrinking the footprint to sub-millimeter [53, 54] or micrometer [23-28] scales. The waveguide architecture of our device could be further optimized to realize a more compact footprint, which is of utmost importance in view of future ultra-dense high-speed parallelized interconnects to facilitate dense modulator arrays [55, 56] for space-division multiplexing applications, and enable advanced complex modulations on a most compact footprint for coherent communications [44, 57]. Besides, the synthesised side-chain polymer could be overlaid on the waveguide core as a cladding material to counterbalance the core’s thermo-optic coefficient, yielding athermal and high-speed MRRs with ultra-compact footprints [48, 49]. As another important aspect of the SPH device, owing to the recent advances in material synthesis and molecular design, more efficient and thermally-stable organic electro-optic materials with higher Tg (175 °C [58], 194 °C [33], and 210 °C [59]) and improved electro-optic activities (Pockels coefficient: 390 pm/V in device at 1.55 \\uf06dm [51, 52]; >290 pm/V in thin films at 1.31 \\uf06dm [58]) are emerging. By incorporating such advanced organic electro-optic materials to effective device architectures, the long-term thermal stability and electro-optic performance of SPH modulators could be substantially improved with a compact footprint in the near future. \\n\\n\\nMethods\\nDevice fabrication. The SPH modulator is fabricated on a standard 4-inch silicon wafer with a 2 μm-thick oxide layer. The bottom SiO2 cladding is firstly prepared on the bottom electrode of 1 μm-thick aluminum from the solution of a sol-gel trimethoxysilyl derivative. After baking the spin-coated film for the sol-gel reaction at 120 °C~140 °C for 3 hours, the 3 μm-thick bottom SiO2 cladding is obtained. A 40 nm-thick silicon layer is deposited by using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, SAMCO, PD-220NL). An MZI structure is then patterned onto the silicon layer by electronic beam lithography (EBL, Elionix, ELS-G100) followed by inductively coupled plasmas (ICP) etching (SAMCO, RIE-400iP) with SF6 gas. The EO polymer is then spin-coated by using cyclopentanone as the solvent and baked at 105 °C for 24 hours under vacuum to form a 1 µm-thick slab. A 3 µm-thick sol-gel SiO2 layer is then spin-coated onto the EO polymer as a top cladding to protect the device during the poling and modulating processes. Travelling-wave microwave strip-line gold electrodes with a length of 8 mm are then deposited onto the device by vacuum deposition and electroplating techniques. To activate the second-order nonlinear effect in polymer, a poling voltage (300 V~400 V) is finally applied across the electrodes around Tg of the EO polymer to align chromophores. After cooling down the device to room temperature and removing the poling voltage, the molecular orientation is frozen, thereby enabling Pockels effects for electro-optic modulations.\\n\\nEnergy consumption of the modulator. The driver electronics of the modulators consume most of the overall energy of the transceiver. The electrical energy per bit dissipated in travelling-wave EO modulator could be calculated by Wbit=(Vpp/2)2/(B·R), where Vpp is the peak-to-peak voltage swing, B is the line rate and R is the driver impendence. For our device, the transmission line impedance is designed to be matched to the 50 Ω driver circuitry. Therefore, for generating 56 Gbit s-1 OOK signals, the driving voltage Vpp=1.3 V results in an electrical energy per bit of 151 fJ bit-1, while for 100 Gbit s-1 OOK systems, the corresponding electrical energy per bit is about 200 fJ bit-1 with Vpp=2.0 V. In the generation of 200 Gbit s-1 Nyquist PAM4, the energy consumption per bit is around 42 fJ bit-1 with Vpp=1.3 V. Note that with dual-drive configuration, the energy consumption could be further reduced. \\n\\nDevice bandwidth characterization. To confirm the broadband operation of the SPH modulator, a vector network analyser (Anritsu, MS4647B, bandwidth: 10 MHz~70 GHz) is used to characterize the frequency response of the fabricated SPH modulator by measuring the electro-optic S21 response. The modulated output optical signal is detected by an O/E calibration module (Anritsu, MN4765B-0072, frequency range: 70 kHz~70 GHz). The maximum measurable upper frequency of the characterization system is limited to 70 GHz. \\n\\nHigh-speed operation characterization. In the experiment for generating high-speed signals at 100 Gbit s-1 and beyond, the setups are depicted in Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b, and Fig. 3a. To generate OOK signals, high-speed electrical signals generated from a pattern generator (SHF, 12104A) followed by an electronic 2:1 multiplexer (SHF, 603A) are fed into the travelling-wave electrode on the device using an RF probe (Fig. 1d, FormFactor, ACP-65-GSG-150, frequency: DC~65 GHz, operating temperature: -65 °C ~200 °C). Another RF probe is attached to the end of the electrode with a 50 \\uf057 termination for power absorption. In the PAM4 signalling, a four-level driving electrical signal is first obtained from an AWG (Keysight, M8196A, analog bandwidth: ~32 GHz) at a 92 GSa s-1 sampling rate, and fed to the SPH modulator after power amplification via a linear driver (SHF, S804B, bandwidth: 90 kHz~60 GHz). In the synthesis of Nyquist PAM4 signals, another AWG (Keysight, M8194A, analog bandwidth: ~45 GHz) at a 120 GSa s-1 sampling rate is used for generating driving electrical signals. The digital signal processing (DSP) at the transmitter side includes up-sampling, raised cosine filtering and down-sampling to form the driving electric signals. To detect the synthesized OOK and PAM4 signals, the received signal is pre-amplified by an erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) before being fed to a photo-detector (Finisar, XPDV3120R, 3-dB cut-off frequency: 75 GHz). Linear feedforward equalizers are deployed for equalizations over the digitized data in performance analysis. \\n\\nHigh-temperature stability assessment. To systemically assess the thermal stability of the fabricated modulators, high-speed performance of the SPH is experimentally investigated when the modulator is being operated at elevated ambient temperatures and after a burn-in test at a high storage temperature. In the performance investigation at high ambient temperatures, the modulator is mounted on an optical stage with a thermoelectric-cooler (TEC) element installed, to alter the operating temperature from 25 °C to 110 °C. In the measurement, the device is activated with optical and electrical connections when temperature is adjusted. On the other hand, to perform the high-temperature storage test, the device is first stored in an oven maintained at a temperature of 90 °C in air without either optical or electrical connections. After the burn-in test, the device is taken out from the oven and then optically and electrically activated to verify its high-speed functionality at room temperature. The high-speed performance of the device before the burn-in test is also conducted at room temperature, providing a benchmark for evaluating the device performance in the long-period high-temperature storage test. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n"," 'Please view the summary tab on each worksheet for the final figures.  \\n\\n\\nIf you have any questions/concerns or need additional information, please let \\nme know.  \\n\\n\\nChris\\n503-464-8219\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMary Hain\\n09/08/2000 06:09 PM\\nTo: Brian.Harrington@ferc.fed.us, michelle.veloso@ferc.fed.us\\ncc: Christi Nicolay, Bill Williams/PDX/ECT@ECT (bcc: Chris Stokley/HOU/ECT)\\nSubject: Enron Data Responses for FERC\\'s Bulk Power Investigation\\n\\nAttached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services\\' \\nresponses to the Staff\\'s data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory \\nCommission\\'s Bulk Power Investigation.

Do you have any insight into what is going on over in the EES world. It looks like I will be on the team that helps sort all of this out and I wanted to see if you had any knowledge on Don Black. Also, who is the gentleman that caused you and Derenda so much grief? I guess this all worked out well for you in the end, since you won\\'t have to sweat all of the decisions that are about to take place for that area of the business. I more than likely will be in Houston quite a bit over the next 6mts, so I will swing by and visit with you and Chad when I find out my schedule.

I will be flying into Houston quite a lot in the short term to get a feeling for what is currently in place for EES. Tim wants Don Black to stay in place for the short term to help him make his way through this mess called EES. Don Black has not been with EES that long, so he is not being hit w/ any of the blame for the current problems. I should have a clearer picture of what is going on in the next couple of weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPs   I am now an Associate.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n \\n\\n Melissa,\\n\\tJust make payment for the Willamette portion of the e-mail below.

You where supposed to come back to me with your plan on how to attack this audit within a week of our conference call.  Why did you not convey this change in status to Murray or myself? And who gave you the direction to put everything on hold until Murray and Kevin spoke? Murray knows nothing about this conversation that is supposed to take place with Kevin Hughes. Let me make this as clear as possible, EPMI is the one that is driving this process and you where given your direction by me to proceed forward on this audit. I expect to see a plan in my hands by the end of this week. All communication going forward are to go through me, and I will make the decision as to who needs to be in to the process.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Chris Stokley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  503-464-8219\\n\\n Please give me an update on where we stand with going forward on the ISO Audit.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n \\n\\n Stewart,\\n\\n\\tI went over Murray\\'s spreadsheet for the CDWR allocation and found some numbers that don\\'t make since to me. I will talk to Murray the moment he walks in the door and get this e-mail to CDWR before 9:00am. There is an adjustment made to the multiplier for CDWR that is specific to only them as a counterparty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChrisBetty,\\n\\n\\tStewart has asked that I send you an e-mail giving you the logic behind  the way in which EPMI arrived at the CDWR payments for December as they relate to the PX index.  EPMI made a payment for December sales to all of our Scheduling Coordinator clients equal to approximately 78% of what they would have received according to the PX hourly index.  This is the approximate methodology that the  PX  used in making its payments to their customers.

He did make sure and state that the London office is the highest cost office in all of Enron, and therefore would probably be the first on to experience layoffs if the economy took a downturn. His thought is that he wants to see if he can get me into something on the floor by mid year, but would support me if I decide to go elsewhere. The tougher issue is going to be telling Murray of my intentions.

I have sent out another mail asking for confirmation.  I will be letting everyone know as soon as I do.\\n\\nDave\\n\\n Bob,\\n\\tI am a little confused, my understanding was that you would be able to escalate these items to get a quick turnaround time in comparison to going the normal process. What you are recommending sounds like the normal process, am I incorrect on that conclusion?  When can I expect to get feedback from CSC with the process listed below? \\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n Pamela,\\n\\tWhere do you get the numbers for the EEMC tab? Here are the stages of the process that I currently know about:\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t1) EES sends the schedule  file to the EPMI server\\n\\t\\t2) Calf. schedulers pull EES schedules into their portfolio and submit the information to the ISO.\\n\\t\\t3) ISO sends back Day Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES original schedule)\\n\\t\\t4) ISO Sends back Hour Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES schedule from the Day Ahead Market)\\n\\n\\tAs you can see, there is quite a few places that changes can occur to an EES schedule in the course of a day. So I am trying to follow the information flow on both the EES side and the EPMI side. If the only schedule you see is the one that is originally sent to the  EPMI server, then I can see where we have the potential to have many unexplained variances. If this is the case, this may be nothing more than providing you with the incremental information that is provided by the ISO during the course of a given day. Just update me on your process flow, and I will keep this issue moving along until completion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Chris\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo:\\tChris Stokley/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:\\t \\nSubject:\\tRe: HA Final Schedules for EES & PGES for 03/26 - 0403   \\n\\nChris,  the spreadsheet below contains the HA_Finals that you send to me(EPMI) as well as the scheduled volumes sent from the scheduling group(EES).  The volumes on the EPMI tab is inconsistent with the EEMC tab.  Please review the variance sheet tab which will denote the days, zone and hours where the difference occur.    I am assuming the EPMI numbers are incorrect because of the hour by hour consistency on the EEMC  spreadsheet.  However,  this assumption could be incorrect.   Again, please review and let me know. \\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nPam\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<Embedded StdOleLink>Pamela,\\n\\tI understand that you are getting your information from the schedulers, my question is at what point in the process. Is this the info that is originally sent to the server with no updates? If so, then we are going to keep having variances until we get you more up to date information. I know that the Calf. schedulers send a new file to EES after the close of the Day Ahead Mrkt, yet I don\\'t see these updated numbers reflected in the schedules that you sent me. Find out from your schedulers if this is the original schedule that is sent to us on the server, and if so, are they updating the file after the changes in the Day-Ahead Mrkt. I want to make sure that you and I are chasing true variances and not timing variances.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  Chris\\n\\n\\nTo:\\tChris Stokley/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:\\t \\nSubject:\\tRe: HA Final Schedules for EES & PGES for 03/26 - 0403   \\n\\nChris, thanks for explaining your process to me.

I have been flying into Houston every week for the past two months, which is getting quite old. I am not sure what will come of this project, but so far I am still dealing w/ Settlement issues. I hear that things are going a lot better for you since we last spoke, promotion, your own book, etc. Monica seems to also be doing quite well in her new role in origination. She did have time to give me shit for not doing a better job of staying in touch. I told her to go slap you in the head and make you install Instant Messenger on your Computer, so please do so. It is about the only way that I get a chance to communicate  w/ anyone these days including my family. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChrisFYI\\n\\n\\n\\n  aAgreed J\\n\\n Thank God we brought Stewart in to clear all of this up!\\n\\n Observe group as Virgina gives us a lesson in kissing up to the boss. J\\n\\n Brenda,\\nHere are the events as I know them\\n1)\\tOn 7/25/01 this item was brought to the attention of varies members of a team meeting for Project Ranger. At that point, it was  agreed that this item should be high priority and Robert Bailey offered to push it forward.\\n2)\\tOn Friday(7/27/01) I got a call from John Rutledge asking if he is the person that is supposed to enter  the WIP to CSC. John had never had any dealing w/ filling out a WIP, plus he is unsure if he is the person to fill it out. (Ball drop number one)\\n3)\\tWIP is finally submitted on 7/30/01. I got a call from Jacqueline Johnson on 8/2/01 asking a bunch of questions about the work request that was submitted by John. At that point I ask why I am just now being contacted if the WIP was submitted on Monday(7/30/01). Jacqueline then goes on to tell me that she has not been in the office that week and is just now getting around to reviewing our WIP request. I then ask why she did not have a backup covering her during her absence and told her she needs to get this out the door ASAP. (Ball drop number two)\\n4)\\tBrenda sends out an e-mail on Friday asking for an update from Richard Miller on the CSC issue. Yesterday at about 11:30 I sent an e-mail to Richard asking for an up date on the e-mail that Brenda sent out. I then get a call from Richard and Steve Walker in which they both told me that this item is not showing as an emergency item to CSC. Both told me that it was never conveyed to them that this was an emergency item, but  they will now escalated it to such. (Ball drop number three)\\n\\nIn summary, John should have been given a lot more guidance in filling the WIP out and getting it submitted to CSC since he has no prior relationship with CSC. As far as the rest of the items listed, I am unsure of where the disconnect in communication occurred at this time. Lastly, where does Robert Gresch fit in all of this since he is the one that I conveyed my concern about this item not looking like it was escalated to emergency status(7/26/01)? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris Stokley\\n \\n\\n Yes, but sadly know one took the initiative to follow through on this item. I had to call today and get the ball rolling because it was never moved to emergency status. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n Richard,\\n\\tThis is the last e-mail that I got from Mr. Gresch. As you can see, I am asking if this has been escalated to something other than the normal process. From the conversation we just had, I guess the level of priority never made it\\'s way to you. While I am not sure who dropped the ball on this item, the fact remains that it was dropped and another week of information that is crucial to the intramonth book was missed. From this point forward, I would like to know who I should be talking with when it comes to these types of issues so as to avoid this miscommunication in the future. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n ?\\n\\nRichard,\\n\\tDo you have an update on this item?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tChris\\n Yes, we do have Outlook.

I should give you a pretty good idea of the variables we are trying to capture in the Deal Ticket. I will be speaking w/ Steve Walker this afternoon to flush this all out in  greater detail. If you have any question please call me at 503-807-8959.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t \\t\\t\\tBrenda,\\n\\tI need to give Jeff Ricter an update on where this item stands with CSC. I am still going off of the e-mail listed below stating that CSC could meet this deliverable by sometime this week. This is the item that we talked about in last week\\'s Project Ranger meeting, and agreed needed to put on the high priority list. If you have any questions on this item, please feel free to call me at 503-807-8959. Thank for your help on this item.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris \\n\\n Diann,\\n\\tYou should have notified me that you had passed this off to Maurice and not acted on it since we talked last Wed. From here on out I will assume that Maurice is the key person to get these issues resolved. Based on the e-mail below, I lost one week by your not having this conversation w/ a CSC rep last week. This is a week that we could not afford to lose. \\n\\nMaurice,\\n\\tLet me know what we need on our side to get the MDMA process escalated to a high priority item. Also, what is the estimated time of delivery from CSC once we make this a priority?  I agree w/ you best scenario recommendation, I would just like to be able to compare delivery dates b/w the two process that you have laid out. Thanks for your help on these items.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPs. When next week can we expect CSC to deliver these accounts to the FTP server? Also, what time the next day can we pull the files off \\n\\t\\t\\t      Of the server?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n \\n\\n Kit,\\n\\tSorry about not being able to get back with you on the PX issue yesterday. I will be wrapped up today until this afternoon. Give the Dan or Clark a call and have them walk you through this invoice, the number are listed at the bottom of the second e-mail. Find out where the PX short pay is encompassed in the account summary(about 9 million dollars). Once you walk through this with them, give me a call on my cell and lets discuss before we comment back to the lawyers. Sorry about having to pass the buck, but they have Murray and I scrambling. Call me on my cell if you need any further guidance.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n\\n\\n Mechelle,\\n\\tI apologize for not getting back w/ you in a timelier manner. I will see if there is any way we can fit something in for tomorrow. If not, we could come by some time during Labor Day week when we are back in town.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChrisIs there anyway you can push this back to the following week when Murray will be in town.\\n\\n What is weird is that Jeff S. is still in the building, so it must have truly been his decision. They are issuing more stk, but I have not yet heard the details on how that will work. As far as Greg, I have heard very little on what lead up to his final departure. I know that his son had just had an operation and I think there may have been some complications. Then throw in a new born and watch the stress level rise.\\n \\n                                                            Chris\\n \\nSure\\n\\n Thanks\\n\\n Sorry to keep bothering you, but do you have this info\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThanks\\n\\t\\t\\t ChrisVal,\\n \\n            Don\\'t know if you heard yet, but  Greg\\'s last day w/ Enron was yesterday\\n \\nTake a look at this document. The section with major players is the one with the utilities that are tied to an index, however, there are some minor utilities that are not covered in that list.

How is everything going in your world? I am getting a lot of projects thrown at me right now, so let me know if there is any deliverables that I owe you. I just want to make sure I am not letting anything slip through the cracks. Hope all is going well, I will try to stop by before I leave out of  Houston this week(Currently spending a lot of time in 3 Allen center).\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPs   I thought you said our stock price would not go below $40.

As far as tracking a deal through the system, we have made very little progress. I have been pulled off on a couple of other projects that were deemed to be of higher priority. I talked to Chris Leonard last week to see if he could be of some help in tracking this down for us since he knows the Risk systems very well. He agreed, and I will follow up w/ him to day on what his approach will be. \\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t503-807-8959http://cnet.com/hardware/0-2709830-404-1781522.html?tag=st.co.2645869-7-1480990.topfive.2709830-404-1781522Thanks for reminding me.

As far as the comment on the SQMD, Murray wants to take a look at the responses which should happen this morning or early afternoon. I would also like to schedule some time this week to sit down and talk about some questions that I have about the audit that fall outside of my responses. Once again I  apologize for the delay and I will have something to you ASAP.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris \\n\\n Kimberly,\\n\\tI am more than happy to get this issue resolved, however, this is the first that I have heard about getting a number to the customer by EOB 9/28/01.Here are some of the questions that I have regarding this deal:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1) What index are we settling this contract at. I see that you have both a 10-min Dec price along with an hourly price in the spreadsheet that you sent me. My \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     is that it would be settled at the Dec since that is what the ISO pays at, but I need confirmation that the customer has agreed to this index.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2) Are the prices you have in your spreadsheet settlement quality since the ISO does not publish any changes to their web site that happen after 96hrs.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3) What method are we using to confirm the customers usage other than him sending us a file.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4) When can we expect to get the usage data for Feb.-July\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5) Are these spreadsheets the detail behind what was invoiced to the customer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6) Do you have a copy of the latest contract with this customer that gives the calculation language appropriate to their over-generation.\\n \\n   I will get this turned around for you as soon a possible once we get the details ironed out on the process. I understand your urgency in wanting to get this settled as soon as possible and I will make sure that happens going forward. However, I will need your patience on getting this settled for Aug. since I have yet to find a documented process for the proper settlement of this contract. Please free to give me a call if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t             Thanks  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris Stokley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t           503-807-8959\\n\\n I think I am only getting billed through Sept., but I will check. As far as the car goes, I am fine w/ just using a cab and I will continue staying at an apartment in Mid-Town(Under someone else\\'s name).\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks\\n\\n \\nJeff,\\n\\tTwo questions:\\n\\t\\t1) Whose name is the apartment in(Do I expense it)?\\n\\t\\t2)  Isn\\'t $107 a day higher than what we currently pay?\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n Every week through Nov. for rt. now. Also, would you mind getting me up to date on the travel expenses you know of ( plane tickets, travel miles, apt. etc.) thanks!\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n We are both open anytime tomorrow.\\n\\n I wanted to get w/ Steve Fisher to discuss the gathering of the different types of contracts that we spoke about in yesterdays meeting. As for the 1:00, I wanted to go over the fields needed to calculate the consumption bands. How much time do you have at 1:00, maybe we can consolidate these meeting and go over all of the fields with Steve and Glenn in the room.\\n\\n See you in Houston! How long are you going to be in the Houston office?\\n\\n \\nFYI\\nAnd you Address\\n\\n John,\\n\\tSend me your new numbers, I can not find them in my address book and I no longer have your e-mail.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChrisThanks for the update, I will be in town and at the Wed. meeting.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n \\nfyi\\n\\nHere are some questions and answers that you will find helpful:\\n*\\tAre self provided ancillary services (on a SC required basis)\\nsequential; excess spin rolls into nonspin requirement for the SC (if\\noffered\\nas nonspin).\\n\\n NO, If an SC self provides 130 MW of SPIN capacity yet the calculated\\nmarket requirement is only 100MW,  the self-provided amount of 120 MW will\\nbe accepted for SPIN and none of the EXCESS 30 MW of capacity considered for\\nother A/S services.\\n\\nPlease Note if in this example the SC\\'s SPIN obligation is calculated to be\\n90 MW, the over self provided portion (100MW - 90MW) = 10 MW would receive a\\npayment.  In this example there is an additional 20 MW of EXCESS above the\\ntotal market requirement that \"gets left on the table\" which will receive no\\ncompensation.\\n\\n\\n*\\tIf self provision reserves are offered in excess of the total\\nquantity required for the total market, will the ISO take them all anyway or\\nwill the offerings be truncated and perhaps roll into a subsequent service\\n(if offered as self provide in that service).\\n\\nNO, As in the above answer.  The total Self provided quantity will be\\naccepted and there would be no reduction of the preferred schedule even if\\nthis amount is ABOVE the total market requirement.\\n\\nAlso, check out M-402 and M-421 at the following link:\\nhttp://www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/marketops/\\n\\n\\n\\nKeoni Almeida\\nCalifornia Independent System Operator\\nphone: 916/608-7053\\npager:  916/814-7352\\nalpha page:  9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net\\ne-mail:  <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com>\\nAJeff,\\n\\tHere is a first cut of some of the questions that  need to be answered by the generator that is offering this service. I will have more as I dig into the detail this    \\tweek.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t1) Non performance by counterparty (don\\'t deliver energy when called) :\\n                                                       - Who is going to be held financially responsible if the generator is unable to meet the ISO instructions to Inc or Dec gen? \\n\\t\\t\\t2)  Is the generator located in the grid or out of the grid?\\n\\t\\t\\t        - This is important to know so that we can evaluate our control area risk.\\n                                                3)   Has the generator registered and been certified by the ISO to deliver all of the A/s Products(Regulation,Spin, Non-Spin and Replacement)\\n\\t\\t\\t        - Need to know the specific unit ID\\'s of the performing units so that we can verify w/ the ISO.\\n                                                4)   Are we paying the Generator based on what we bid in to the ISO or on what the ISO actually grants to EPMI. \\n\\t\\t\\t5)   Are we paying the Generator a fixed price on Capacity and Energy or just passing through what the ISO pays EPMI minus losses for energy.\\n\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tOther risks that we need to take look at as EPMI\\n\\t\\t\\t1)   Will the revenue stream coming in from the A/S payments put EPMI at risk of becoming a Creditor to the ISO instead of a Debtor.\\n\\t\\t\\t2)   EPMI reputation w/ the ISO if the Generator has perpetual non-performance issues. This could impact all of our A/S business if the ISO feels \\n\\t\\t\\t       that EPMI is not able to meet its A/S obligation to the ISO on a consistent basis.\\n\\t\\t\\t3)   Need to make sure that they have language in the contract that covers EPMI and EES if we loss a dispute to the ISO. \\n                                                4)   Risk to EPMI if the generator fails to deliver energy and the ISO takes back all capacity payment back to the last time in which EPMI\\n\\t\\t\\t       performed on an energy call. I think this is based on the entire EPMI portfolio not just for a specific unit.

As far as the percentage of Calf. contracts that have  band consumption, my assumption is that it is quite high. I base this on our discussion w/ Dennis and my talks w/ Neil Bresnen. My understanding is that all contracts that where written after first quarter of 1999, have some type of  band consumption language in them.  I spoke w/ Joshua yesterday and I feel that we are making the progress that I would expect at this point. I would like to meet w/ you when I get back in Houston on Monday if you have the time. Also, Joshua is supposed to send me an update today so that I can better assess as to where we are at on the consumption band initiative.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPS.

Any help you can give Pam would be quite beneficial and appreciated by both her and I. She is getting zero help down here and that is why I pointed her you your direction. I have not dug down in the process, but is seems to be way to  manual for all parties involved. I just want the process improved so that it takes some of the manual error work out the flow. Give me a call at 713-345-6120 if you need anything.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Chris\\n\\n \\nGeiv,\\n\\tJust curious, who do you think has time to go over the mistakes that you may have made in these spreadsheets? For the time being, Pam will take care of this process for you. In return, you will be given a 24hr timeline to get all discrepancies answered and cleaned up in Deal Tracker. I feel this is a fair timeline since Pam is the person doing the leg work to identify all discrepancies. If you have any questions or suggestion on this process, feel free to call me at 56120.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris Stokley\\n Gang,\\n\\tI want to make it very clear that the questions I am having Pam ask are not meant to put anyone one on the defensive. From what I can tell so far, we have a process that is at best inefficient and at worst broken. Pam will be asking a lot of questions going forward because she does not know your process and she is on task to learn it. Please have patience and offer guidance on how we can get these issues resolved so we can better put to use everyone\\'s time. We are all paid to fix problems, not point fingers. I have a lot of faith in the people in the Portland office, that is why I am asking Pam to go to you guys for guidance. If anyone has any issues going forward please feel free to contact me at 503-807-8959 or e-mail me. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t          Thanks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChris\\n\\n Holly: HHunsucker@austin.rr.com\\nRachel: Rav.sav@verizon.com\\n\\n\\t\\tAs far a Greg W. goes, no not as of yet.\\n\\n Works for me\\n\\nSteve,\\n\\tI would like you to be in this meeting when we lock down a time and date/\\n\\n Thank you\\n\\n \\nFYI\\n I agree with the content of John\\'s e-mail except for the pricing delivery date. I will not have the pricing completed until sometime late Monday night. I am in flight to Houston until 2:00CST, at which point I will be in meeting until late Monday evening. I looked at the queries this weekend, so it should not take long to put the necessary fixes in place.  Everyone on this e-mail will have the pricing information in their e-mail when they walk in on Tuesday morning. I apologize if I did not make that clear during our phone conversation. Also, I would like to have a discussion at some point on how we will handle this customer going forward.

It was also brought to my attention that you want to minimize the time you spend on this process, I would agree with that.

I\\'ll come over there and show you where it is \\nexactly\\n\\nhttp://gasfundy.dev.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.aspFolks,\\n\\nThis note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress \\ntoward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line \\nof products.  \\n\\nIt is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane \\nwarning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative \\nproducts that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this \\nexposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural \\ncounterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:\\n\\nPro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane\\nThe Weather Channel    Resorts\\nHome Depot     Cruise Ships    \\nLowes      Riverboat Casinos\\nCNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries\\nLocal TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces\\nDry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams\\nChainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments\\nInsect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments\\n\\n\\nIt is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is \\nimportant to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature \\nwhile the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have \\ndocumented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the \\nthought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional \\nproducts and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in \\nbundled regional products depending on their exposure.\\n\\nThus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data \\nfrom 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by \\nyear, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning \\nduration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary \\ndata sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S \\ncoast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly \\nsimilar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North \\nCarolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida \\nPanhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.\\n\\nWhile this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it \\nhas confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration \\nis quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, \\nwhen graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to \\neffectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning \\nfrequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be \\nwell aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly \\nprobably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.\\n\\nAs we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be \\nscrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, \\nsatellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go \\nfurther back in time so long as the accuracy doesn\\'t decline.\\n\\nOn the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the \\nWeather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given \\nour positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the \\neasiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when \\nwe should approach customers.\\n\\nPlease respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFolks,\\n\\nAttached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the \\npetrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged \\ndrought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and \\npossible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these \\nassets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the \\nestimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other \\nfacilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.\\n\\nNote that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial \\ncomplexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to \\nexperience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties \\nidentified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado, \\nNavidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine \\nwhether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\nDavid,\\n\\nHere are the reviews of the UT Energy Finance program that  you requested:\\n\\n\\nFrom Jennifer Martinez  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of=20\\n1998):\\n\\nThe Energy Finance Program 2 years ago was very good, especially considerin=\\ng=20\\nit was the first year of the program.  There were a lot of guest speakers=\\n=20\\nfrom various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge abou=\\nt=20\\nthe energy industry through case studies, lectures, etc.  Basically, we=20\\nlearned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance=\\n=20\\nclasses, but all the cases and examples were energy-related.  The professor=\\ns=20\\nwere good for the most part but didn\\'t have a great deal of practical=20\\nindustry experience.  If I had to guess the reason for decreased=20\\nparticipation in the program, I would probably say it is the professors. =\\n=20\\nRonn and Titman are great but known as being very technical and=20\\nquantitative.  Some students prefer less technical professors and classes=\\n=20\\nthat aren\\'t limiting to the energy industry.  Also, the fact that the class=\\n=20\\nmeets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing.  Other than those=\\n=20\\nthings, I can\\'t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment.  I=20\\nespecially don\\'t understand why every single person didn\\'t drop for Enron. =\\n I=20\\nwonder if it has something to do with international status.???=20\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFrom John Massey  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):\\n\\nBottom Line -\\n\\nUT Business Schools is great - Investment Fund - Best Activity available to=\\n=20\\nstudents\\nEnergy Finance program - Fairly Weak -\\nIt was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a=\\n=20\\nweak finance appendage -\\nThe Finance teacher was pathetic - both a poor teacher, ignorant about=20\\nindustry specific analysis, devoid of industry experience, rude to outside=\\n=20\\nlectures (from industry)\\nKeith Brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small=\\n=20\\nportion of the class time -\\n\\nWay to make Better:\\nGet teachers with practical industry experience -\\nMake it a seminar Class - Focus on Case studies, lectures - given by people=\\n=20\\nfrom industry -\\nPromote the class within the business school - I felt like UT did a poor jo=\\nb=20\\nof internally (to students) promoting the class -\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n-----------\\n\\nFrom Ross Mesquita  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):\\n\\nTo be honest, a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific.  =\\n=20\\nWhen energy applications were presented, it seemed more like general financ=\\ne=20\\nquestions were reworded to include energy lingo.  We had some very good=20\\nspeakers, but for the most part, I did not feel like the 6 hours of class h=\\nad=20\\nenough energy focus.  I assumed that this would get better as the program=\\n=20\\nprogressed.\\n\\nOne reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that Energy=20\\nFinance is a very specific focus.  I would have probably not enrolled in th=\\ne=20\\nEnergy Finance program had it been available in my first year.  I did not=\\n=20\\nknow enough about energy at that time and I had returned to B-school to=20\\nconsider several career options -- i.e., investment banking, corporate=20\\nfinance, entrepreneurship, marketing, etc.  As a new MBA student, I would n=\\not=20\\nwant to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies. =20\\n\\nHere is my perspective and probably something that is true of many MBAs--\\n\\nMy interest in Enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa. =\\n=20\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n----------\\n\\nFrom Billy Braddock   (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998=\\n):\\n\\nI was a participant in the inaugural Energy Finance program in the Fall of=\\n=20\\n1998.  The primary positives to the class revolved around outside=20\\npanels/instruction.  For example, Enron sent representatives on 2 separate=\\n=20\\noccasions to discuss particular topics (Vince Kaminski and Gary Hickerson).=\\n =20\\nOther notable speakers were Jeff Sandefer (independent business consultant=\\n=20\\nand E&P professional), the Beacon Group, and Encap Investments.  Another go=\\nod=20\\nspeaker was a professor from UT\\'s school of engineering.  He brought a good=\\n=20\\nperspective as to the \"basics\" of the energy business.\\n\\nThe class was structured via a team-based instruction approach, with 3=20\\nprofessors team-teaching a 6-hour credit course.  None of the 3 professors=\\n=20\\nhad any product knowledge of the energy business.  Of the 3 professors, 2=\\n=20\\nwere research focussed/tenured with little credibility in \"teaching.\"  One =\\nof=20\\nthe professors primary focus of research was fixed income, while the other =\\n2=20\\nwere investments and corporate finance, respectively. =20\\n\\nAs is the case for UT\\'s finance program in general, and energy finance in=\\n=20\\nparticular, UT is in dire need of teaching professors (as opposed to resear=\\nch=20\\nprofessors) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples=\\n=20\\nand at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a=\\n=20\\nfinance background.  Particular to the energy program, UT needs to have mor=\\ne=20\\ninstruction from energy professionals (such as the instructors used for=20\\nEnron\\'s internal learning programs (ie. Derivatives classes, etc.).\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n-----------------------\\n\\nFrom Bryan Williams  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998)=\\n:\\n\\nI participated in the first Energy Finance class offered in Fall of 1998, a=\\nt=20\\nthe University of Texas. =20\\n\\nThe curriculum was understandably =01&rough around the edges=018 as 1998 wa=\\ns the=20\\nfirst year the Energy Finance course was offered.  However, the instruction=\\n=20\\nalso suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak=\\n=20\\nof (The 6-credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors).=\\n=20\\n\\nTwo of the three professors have co-authored textbooks, and the third=20\\nprofessor=01,s claim to fame is fixed income.  As a group, the three profes=\\nsors=20\\nare research-heavy (as opposed to industry focused), and the team-teaching=\\n=20\\nformat did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for=\\n=20\\nthe success of the class. =20\\n\\nThat said, the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside=\\n=20\\nspeakers.

It is our objective to develop derivative \\nproducts that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this \\nexposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural \\ncounterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:\\n\\nPro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane\\nThe Weather Channel    Resorts\\nHome Depot     Cruise Ships    \\nLowes      Riverboat Casinos\\nCNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries\\nLocal TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces\\nDry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams\\nChainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments\\nInsect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments\\n\\n\\nIt is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is \\nimportant to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature \\nwhile the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have \\ndocumented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the \\nthought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional \\nproducts and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in \\nbundled regional products depending on their exposure.\\n\\nThus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data \\nfrom 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by \\nyear, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning \\nduration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary \\ndata sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S \\ncoast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly \\nsimilar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North \\nCarolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida \\nPanhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.\\n\\nWhile this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it \\nhas confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration \\nis quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, \\nwhen graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to \\neffectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning \\nfrequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be \\nwell aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly \\nprobably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.\\n\\nAs we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be \\nscrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, \\nsatellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go \\nfurther back in time so long as the accuracy doesn\\'t decline.\\n\\nOn the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the \\nWeather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given \\nour positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the \\neasiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when \\nwe should approach customers.\\n\\nPlease respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFolks,\\n\\nAs a follow-up to Scott Neal\\'s inquiry this morning concerning \\nportable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no \\nsuch capability currently exists.\\nAccording to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this \\nopportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far \\nas we know, has\\nconstructed such a vessel.  \\n\\nI did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the \\nItalian company,Tecnomare.

I did not=\\n=20\\nknow enough about energy at that time and I had returned to B-school to=20\\nconsider several career options -- i.e., investment banking, corporate=20\\nfinance, entrepreneurship, marketing, etc.  As a new MBA student, I would n=\\not=20\\nwant to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies. =20\\n\\nHere is my perspective and probably something that is true of many MBAs--\\n\\nMy interest in Enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa. =\\n=20\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n----------\\n\\nFrom Billy Braddock   (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998=\\n):\\n\\nI was a participant in the inaugural Energy Finance program in the Fall of=\\n=20\\n1998.  The primary positives to the class revolved around outside=20\\npanels/instruction.  For example, Enron sent representatives on 2 separate=\\n=20\\noccasions to discuss particular topics (Vince Kaminski and Gary Hickerson).=\\n =20\\nOther notable speakers were Jeff Sandefer (independent business consultant=\\n=20\\nand E&P professional), the Beacon Group, and Encap Investments.  Another go=\\nod=20\\nspeaker was a professor from UT\\'s school of engineering.  He brought a good=\\n=20\\nperspective as to the \"basics\" of the energy business.\\n\\nThe class was structured via a team-based instruction approach, with 3=20\\nprofessors team-teaching a 6-hour credit course.  None of the 3 professors=\\n=20\\nhad any product knowledge of the energy business.  Of the 3 professors, 2=\\n=20\\nwere research focussed/tenured with little credibility in \"teaching.\"  One =\\nof=20\\nthe professors primary focus of research was fixed income, while the other =\\n2=20\\nwere investments and corporate finance, respectively. =20\\n\\nAs is the case for UT\\'s finance program in general, and energy finance in=\\n=20\\nparticular, UT is in dire need of teaching professors (as opposed to resear=\\nch=20\\nprofessors) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples=\\n=20\\nand at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a=\\n=20\\nfinance background.  Particular to the energy program, UT needs to have mor=\\ne=20\\ninstruction from energy professionals (such as the instructors used for=20\\nEnron\\'s internal learning programs (ie. Derivatives classes, etc.).\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n-----------------------\\n\\nFrom Bryan Williams  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998)=\\n:\\n\\nI participated in the first Energy Finance class offered in Fall of 1998, a=\\nt=20\\nthe University of Texas. =20\\n\\nThe curriculum was understandably =01&rough around the edges=018 as 1998 wa=\\ns the=20\\nfirst year the Energy Finance course was offered.  However, the instruction=\\n=20\\nalso suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak=\\n=20\\nof (The 6-credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors).=\\n=20\\n\\nTwo of the three professors have co-authored textbooks, and the third=20\\nprofessor=01,s claim to fame is fixed income.  As a group, the three profes=\\nsors=20\\nare research-heavy (as opposed to industry focused), and the team-teaching=\\n=20\\nformat did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for=\\n=20\\nthe success of the class. =20\\n\\nThat said, the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside=\\n=20\\nspeakers.  Among them: Vince=20\\nKaminski & Gary Hickerson, both of Enron.  They also dedicated one class=20\\nperiod to a video conference call with the Beacon Group, an energy consulti=\\nng=20\\ngroup that I believe was recently acquired by Goldman.\\nJeff Sandefer, an independent businessman, an entreprenuership instructor,=\\n=20\\nand one of the foremost experts in the E&P sector, also spoke to the class.=\\n =20\\nJeff was joined by some of the executives from Houston-based Encap.\\n\\nThe woes of the Energy Finance could be easily remedied by injecting some=\\n=20\\ninstruction from someone from industry.    The class is too=20\\nacademic/theoretical with too few relevant examples excerpted from the ener=\\ngy=20\\nsector.=20\\n\\nThe instructors Enron uses for the Derivatives courses taught internally ar=\\ne=20\\ngood examples of people who can package very relevant information and=20\\nsuccessfully articulate it in a couple of days.  Perhaps a similar approach=\\n=20\\nwould bode well for the Energy Finance program at UT. =20\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n----------------------------\\nFrom Yuan Tian  (MBA class of 2000, Energy Finance taken fall of 1999):\\n\\nHere are my thoughts on the UT Energy Finance Program:\\n\\nPros:\\n- more focused on the Finance studies in the Energy Industry which is right=\\n=20\\nnow in a transition period from regulation to deregulation and thus is=20\\nexposed to different financial perspectives from the other industries;\\n- there are some experienced, brand-name professors (e.g. Sheridan Titman)=\\n=20\\nteaching in the program;=20\\n\\nCons:\\n- the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies=\\n=20\\nsuch as Enron. Specifically, it might need to help students link to the=20\\ninterview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as Enron;\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFrom George Huan  (MBA class of 2000, Energy Finance taken fall of 1999):\\n\\nCompanies expect MBA students to have both general management (new ideas) a=\\nnd=20\\nanalytic (quantative) skills.  Energy industry is no exception.\\n\\nEnergy Finance Program offers Financial Strategy and Risk Managements cours=\\nes=20\\nwhich fit in the insudtry need.  However, these two courses are far from=20\\nenough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation=\\n=20\\nand excitements and opportunities in this industry.   Other management and=\\n=20\\nquantitive courses are needed to complete this program.=20\\nMy suggestions:\\n\\n1) Seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies. Before=\\n=20\\nstudents make their decisions, let them know:  What\\'s happening and what\\'s=\\n=20\\ngoing to happen in this industry;  What the companies are doing now;  Who=\\n=20\\nthey are looking for. =20\\n2) Management and/or analytical courses should be included.  Such as:=20\\nStrategy, Financial enginering and Real Option.\\n3) More industry connections. Presentations and discussions.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nFrom Charlie Weldon (MBA Class of 2000, Energy Finance taken in fall of 199=\\n9)\\n\\nMy experience in the Energy Finance program overall was a positive=20\\nexperience.  The most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers=20\\nbrought in during Dr. Titman\\'s portion of the class.  This part of the cour=\\nse=20\\nis taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~10 case=20\\nclasses all focusing on the Energy industry.  Two of the cases were based o=\\nn=20\\nEnron, and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate an=\\nd=20\\nwell thought out.  Value added by the professor was less than from the=20\\nspeakers and cases.\\n\\nThe first eight  weeks of the course covered futures and options.  Nearly a=\\nll=20\\nof the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy=20\\nindustry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student\\'s=20\\nunderstanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market.  The u=\\nse=20\\nof options and futures for speculating and/or hedging was stressed on=20\\nnumerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power=\\n=20\\nplant project.\\n\\nI believe that the University Energy Finance faculty are trying to=20\\ncontinuously make improvements to the program.  However, I do not believe=\\n=20\\nthat they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to=20\\nimprovement.   There is a strong need for more practical based training on=\\n=20\\nenergy derivatives similar to the course taught by Paradigm here at Enron. =\\n=20\\nThe focus of the University teachers is quite theoretical, due in large par=\\nt=20\\nto their background.  While the theoretical basis is crucial to understandi=\\nng=20\\nthe basics, the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective=\\n=20\\nbridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course. =20\\n\\nUntil measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive=\\n=20\\nindustry experience, I believe the Energy Finance program will continue to=\\n=20\\nunderdeliver on its objectives.  Additionally, I believe that the course=20\\nstructure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive=\\n=20\\nhours of classroom instruction.Folks,\\n\\nThis note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress \\ntoward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line \\nof products.  \\n\\nIt is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane \\nwarning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative \\nproducts that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this \\nexposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural \\ncounterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:\\n\\nPro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane\\nThe Weather Channel    Resorts\\nHome Depot     Cruise Ships    \\nLowes      Riverboat Casinos\\nCNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries\\nLocal TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces\\nDry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams\\nChainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments\\nInsect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments\\n\\n\\nIt is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is \\nimportant to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature \\nwhile the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have \\ndocumented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the \\nthought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional \\nproducts and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in \\nbundled regional products depending on their exposure.\\n\\nThus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data \\nfrom 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by \\nyear, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning \\nduration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary \\ndata sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S \\ncoast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly \\nsimilar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North \\nCarolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida \\nPanhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.\\n\\nWhile this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it \\nhas confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration \\nis quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, \\nwhen graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to \\neffectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning \\nfrequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be \\nwell aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly \\nprobably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.\\n\\nAs we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be \\nscrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, \\nsatellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go \\nfurther back in time so long as the accuracy doesn\\'t decline.\\n\\nOn the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the \\nWeather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given \\nour positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the \\neasiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when \\nwe should approach customers.\\n\\nPlease respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy supervisor is Ed Mc Michael.thanksyeah, I\\'m not sure I\\'m going to fork out the $60 to take my family now, versus $15 and being less crowded.\\nThe University of Texas at Austin\\nTEXASMBA\\nAdmission Visit Initiative Candidate Critique Form\\n\\nAlumni / Program Contact Name:   V.

(NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)\\n\\n1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron\\'s 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce\\'s 82MW.\\n\\n2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our \"bought-down\" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:\\n\\n\\n\\n   MONTH\\tTotal Capacity Needed By Enron\\tFt.

Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.\\n\\n4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)\\n\\n5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.\\n\\n6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft.

I want to do \\nmy best to represent you fairly and actively.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate my task, I would really appreciate that all of you \\nforward to me, by email:\\n\\n1. a list of your accomplishments in year 2000 (should be not more than 10 to \\n12 bullet points, telegraphic style)\\n2. a decently recent resume, that shows your school, previous work experience \\nand start date at Enron.\\n3. a list of all of your rotations at Enron since hired.\\n\\n4.

I should have an additional 16 \\nhours left due to the 10 hours that accrued on 12/31/00 and the 6 I had left \\nover.  Can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system?\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie WeldonShares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around \\nagain yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that \\nsent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of \\n$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. \\nThe pullback doesn\\'t appear to be company-specific exactly, although the \\nrumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering \\naftershocks\\n throughout the U.S. energy community. \\n\\nAs we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California \\nhas rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and \\nthe uncertain \\nprofit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing \\nsufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. \\n\\nThe state\\'s two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, \\nBoards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are \\nfacing the\\n prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity \\npurchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge \\ntheir customers\\n for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the \\ngradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. \\n\\nThe risks to Enron are two-fold. \\n\\nFor one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the \\nstate\\'s major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the \\ncompany does\\n operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a \\nconsiderable degree because of Enron\\'s size, strength, and diversified global \\nrevenue\\n streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default \\npayees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the \\nregion. \\n\\nMore significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may \\npull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis \\nabates. Some also\\n fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as \\nregulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended \\neconomic consequences. \\n\\nNeither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was \\nderegulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination \\nalong the way. And a \\nstrong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have \\npressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. \\n\\nThe California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best \\ncourse of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E \\nand Edison\\'s\\n ultimate fate, the state\\'s energy consumers will likely absorb much of the \\nburden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. \\n\\nEnron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks \\non the heels of the Federal Reserve\\'s unexpected interest-rate cuts last \\nweek. The initial\\n euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts \\nwill serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic \\neconomic\\n growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, \\nwe expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized \\ndefensive plays\\n like Enron. \\n\\nWe would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron\\'s favor have been \\noverlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was\\n 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in \\nthe past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly \\nin natural \\ngas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an \\nenvironment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. \\n\\nIn addition, Enron\\'s diversification into still more new avenues of growth \\nhelp to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the \\nfuture. The \\nmarkets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and \\nEnron\\'s broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next \\nyear.\\nAn eventual inflection point in the groups\\' profitability would serve to send \\nprofits measurably higher in the long term. \\n\\nDespite the recent turmoil, Enron\\'s consensus earnings estimate for 2001, \\naccording to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. \\nAlthough the \\nstock\\'s rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term \\nvolatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the \\nmarket \\napproves of Enron\\'s maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going \\nforward\\n I don\\'t disagree with your view, but I wouldn\\'t count broadband out yet.  It \\nmay be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.  If it \\ndoesn\\'t then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.\\n\\nBy the way,  I doubled up on JPM today.  It\\'s showed me a profit you \\nknow.....713-345-7229Try author Harry S.

Remember that this \\nis a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering \\nthat the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate \\nwhat the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get \\nyou the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\nThe taxes that you owe will be based on any gain on whatever we sell.  It \\nwill be much less than $2000.  For instance, if we bought $1500 of Enron \\nstock that is noe worth $2000 then you will only pay tax on the $500 gain.  \\nI\\'ll look at it tonight.got my money back..   i offerred 2 at 3-1/8 and they were gone in 5 minutes   \\nnow I\\'m playing with profit and can let em ride.She hasn\\'t heard it yet as she was feeling so bad yesterday.

Investing, One Stock=20\\n=20\\nBroad Horizons=20\\n=20\\nby Jeff Schlegel=20\\n=20\\nDecember 2000, \"Worth\" magazine=20\\n=20\\nEnergy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear=\\nt=20\\nof the new economy.=20\\n =20\\nEnron (NYSE: ENE) President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling=20\\nhates his office, a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company\\'s=\\n=20\\ndowntown\\nHouston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its=\\n=20\\nhaughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy=\\n=20\\nmarkets=20\\nwere highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron\\'s three=\\n=20\\ncommodity-trading floors =01* the company\\'s nerve centers, where it buys an=\\nd=20\\nsells products=20\\nranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20\\noften casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=\\n=20\\ntraders. \"That\\'s=20\\nhow you find out what\\'s going on,\" he says.\\n\\nSkilling doesn\\'t think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=\\nt=20\\nlike an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=\\n=20\\nonline\\n presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=\\ng=20\\nto capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=\\n=20\\nand electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20\\nindustries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20\\ninsatiable demand,=20\\nhas jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=\\n=20\\ntheir customers. That suits Enron just fine.\\n\\nNew Economy Initiatives\\nThe company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=\\n=20\\nits regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation\\'s largest buyer\\n and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=\\n=20\\ntrading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=\\ns=20\\nreally electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron\\'s new-economy=\\n=20\\ninitiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=\\nng=20\\nsystem, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=\\n=20\\nmore than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20\\nNext it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=\\n=20\\ndelivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading\\n bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20\\nmillion in revenue for the first nine months of this year.\\n\\nAlthough energy remains Enron\\'s main source of revenue and earnings,=20\\nmanagement believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=\\nap\\n into new markets. \"In five years, we will be a substantially different=20\\ncompany,\" says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. \"Underlying=20\\neverything we=20\\ndo is the ability to make markets more efficient.\" Along with bandwidth,=20\\nEnron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=\\ns=20\\ntrading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=\\n=20\\nand data storage. \"Trading is the ultimate scalable concept,\" adds Skilling=\\n.=20\\n\"We\\'re\\n using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20\\npotential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited.\"\\n\\nInvestors have bought into Enron\\'s vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=\\nh=20\\nat a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=\\ne=20\\nbig\\n question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20\\nEnron\\'s stock price and what happens if the company\\'s broadband strategy=20\\ndoesn\\'t=20\\nunfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.\\n\\n\"We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20\\nsuited for the changing economy.\"\\n=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron\\n\\nCompany Culture\\nEnron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20\\nmanagement down, employees have little doubt that they\\'re creating=20\\nrevolutionary\\n new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20\\nEnron\\'s headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20\\nticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron\\'s stock price.\\n\\nManagement\\nKen Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=\\n=20\\nthe company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=\\n=20\\nwhere he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=\\n=20\\nforces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being\\nderegulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=\\nes=20\\ncould charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=\\ns.=20\\nBut=20\\nwith deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=\\n=20\\nand consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The\\n new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =\\na=20\\ntrading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=\\n=20\\nprocess with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=\\n=20\\nin the 1990s.\\n\\nLay has long been hailed as Enron\\'s visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=\\nh.=20\\n\"Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I\\'ve ever known,\" sa=\\nys=20\\nLay,=20\\nwho began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20\\nconsultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. \"I\\'ve made it clea=\\nr=20\\nfor\\n some time that he\\'s my successor.\" The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=\\ny=20\\njoined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when\\n describing the company\\'s business. Lay\\'s language is slightly less colorfu=\\nl=20\\nbut no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron\\'s future.\\n\\nLay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20\\nbottom. \"We\\'ve flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=\\nd=20\\ndeveloped a culture to take risks and try new ideas,\" Lay says. Take Michae=\\nl=20\\nMoulton, 30, who is working in Enron\\'s pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=\\n=20\\ncame up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=\\nt=20\\nbegins its operations later this year, he will run it.\\n\\nWholesale Energy\\nDespite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=\\n=20\\nstill at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=\\n=20\\nyear,=20\\nnearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20\\nenergy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20\\nrisk-management=20\\nproducts for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=\\nom=20\\nits own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=\\n=20\\nbought=20\\nfrom other energy producers with excess capacity.\\n\\nThe company\\'s trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20\\nEnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=\\n=20\\nMargins\\n are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =\\nof=20\\nelectricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn\\'t doing trades just=\\n=20\\nto=20\\nmake money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =\\nit=20\\nto package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20\\ncontracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=\\n=20\\nprincipal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=\\n=20\\nthe product,=20\\nbe it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20\\nwholesale energy business average one to three percent.\\n\\nTrading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=\\nr=20\\nthan Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=\\nce=20\\nmoves. \"Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20\\nmodeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20\\nthroughout=20\\nthe country,\" says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=\\ns=20\\nwho closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20\\nmeteorologists=20\\non its gas-trading floor to monitor any weather changes =01* from an oncomi=\\nng=20\\ncold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th=\\nat=20\\ncould affect=20\\nsupply and demand.\\n\\nNow Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=\\n=20\\nderegulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20\\nScandinavia=20\\nin the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20\\nmaking markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20\\nstill loom large and=20\\nnational differences present formidable hurdles. \"We\\'re the only company wi=\\nth=20\\npan-European operations,\" says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy\\n unit. \"There\\'s a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it\\'s=20\\ndifficult.\"\\n\\nBroadband Operations\\nThe roots of Enron\\'s bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20\\nbought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=\\ny\\n market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=\\ns=20\\ngas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20\\nbeing deployed,=20\\n\"the Enron mind-set of \\'Can we trade this stuff?\\' kicked in,\" says Kenneth=\\n=20\\nRice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. \"Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=\\ng=20\\ntraded like=20\\na commodity.\"\\n\\nToday Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=\\n=20\\ncarriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest\\n (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=\\n=20\\nsells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=\\n=20\\ncarriers,\\n and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=\\n=20\\nfor a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20\\n15,000 miles\\n and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.\\n\\nEnron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=\\n=20\\nwhich up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=\\ns=20\\ninto=20\\npaying for capacity they don\\'t always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20\\ndemand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=\\ns=20\\nof=20\\ntime =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=\\nf its=20\\nCEO to its offices around the globe.\\n\\nThe company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20\\nmonthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=\\nn=20\\na Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=\\n a=20\\nspeed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron\\n delivered 1,399 months\\' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20\\nquarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20\\nmonths. Both\\n Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20\\nannual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=\\ngy=20\\ncontributed=20\\nin 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=\\n=20\\nbroadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=\\n=20\\n$2=20\\nbillion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).\\n\\nThe other major piece of Enron\\'s broadband strategy centers on delivering=\\n=20\\nstreaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches\\n made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=\\n=20\\nalong with its own internally developed software, Enron\\'s broadband system\\n is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=\\nge=20\\nfrom corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=\\nE:=20\\nBBI),=20\\nwhich this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=\\n=20\\nEnron\\'s network. \"Video will be the king application,\" Skilling says. \"That=\\n\\'s=20\\nwhere=20\\nit\\'s all going to happen.\"\\n\\nOther Growth Drivers\\nSome people may have questioned Enron\\'s decision to plunk down $100 million=\\n=20\\nfor the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros\\' new=20\\nretractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20\\n30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=\\n=20\\nstadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=\\n=20\\nmillion in the process.\\n\\nEnergy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=\\n=20\\nbusinesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=\\nr=20\\noperations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=\\n=20\\nfrom analyzing a company\\'s energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20\\nenergy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20\\ngear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group\\n (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=\\n=20\\nbillion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon\\'s 253 real-estate=\\n=20\\nproperties. \"The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you\\'re=\\n=20\\ngoing to be the leader, you\\'ve got to know every detail,\" says Marty Sunde,\\nhead of the group\\'s North American unit.\\n\\nEnergy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=\\nt=20\\nsometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20\\nin 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=\\n=20\\nbefore interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=\\n=20\\ntarget to=20\\nland $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year\\'s total.=\\n=20\\n\"There\\'s no reason this business can\\'t roughly double in each of the next f=\\new=20\\nyears,\"=20\\nLay says.\\n\\n\"Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=\\n=20\\nbut their track record warrants that.\"\\n=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham\\n\\nThe Competition\\nSome of Enron\\'s trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=\\nhe=20\\nderegulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.\\n Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=\\nnd=20\\ncalled \"Enron Jr.\" by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20\\nelectricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=\\n=20\\nsame goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is\\n much larger than Enron\\'s. A consortium of six energy companies, including=\\n=20\\nAquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20\\nenergy-trading=20\\nsystem to rival EnronOnline.\\n\\nSeveral existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=\\ne=20\\n(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards\\n for companies to find trading partners. They don\\'t actually deliver the=20\\nproduct, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20\\nbusiness,=20\\nEnron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=\\nl=20\\nutilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron\\'s geographic scope.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a challenge to value Enron\\'s stock, because it\\'s such a hybrid. It=20\\nalways seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations.\"\\n=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.\\n\\nWhat It\\'s Worth\\nAnalysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=\\n=20\\nits four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20\\nalso typically value the company\\'s businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=\\nt=20\\nto be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron\\'s income because its business=\\nes\\n are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=\\n=20\\n$80, Enron\\'s pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=\\n=20\\nvalued at $5,\\nwholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=\\n=20\\n$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=\\n=20\\nenergy=20\\nis too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20\\nyear, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron\\'s projected total EBIT. And=\\n=20\\nwholesale=20\\nenergy\\'s EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=\\nhe=20\\nnext five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20\\nmarkets.=20\\nCombine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=\\n=20\\nbroadband,=20\\nnot to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=\\nng=20\\nargues, Enron\\'s stock is easily worth $130.\\n\\nAnalysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20\\nhigher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=\\ns=20\\nstill=20\\na couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=\\n=20\\nBarney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20\\npotential=20\\nof bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=\\n=20\\nmarket could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=\\n=20\\nmid-1990s.\\n Niles thinks Enron\\'s overall energy operations alone are worth more than=\\n=20\\nEnron\\'s current share price. If that\\'s true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=\\n=20\\nfor bandwidth\\n would make Enron a $100 stock.\\n\\nUltimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20\\nEnron meets analysts\\' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=\\nr=20\\n=01* and\\n maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=\\n $92.\\n\\nSocial Responsibility\\nEnron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce=\\n=20\\nmethane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But=\\n=20\\ncertain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant =\\nin=20\\nIndia, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20\\nprotests=20\\nagainst the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20\\nRights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th=\\ne=20\\nsuppression of dissent and didn\\'t speak out against human rights violations=\\n.=20\\nEnron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000\\n to improve the community\\'s water and sanitation infrastructures.\\n\\nThe Upside\\nWith less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20\\ncompetition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie=\\nve=20\\nthe entire=20\\nmarket will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20\\nexpand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could=\\n=20\\nget a=20\\nboost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:=\\n=20\\nAOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via\\n the Internet. Enron\\'s attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi=\\na=20\\nended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn\\'t one of=\\n=20\\nits strengths.=20\\nSo it\\'s relying on IBM\\'s back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and=\\n=20\\nAOL\\'s Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power.\\n\\nThe Downside\\nThe much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.=\\n=20\\nCurrently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and\\n Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called=\\n=20\\nlast-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving=\\n=20\\nvery=20\\nslowly.

Let\\'s discuss if \\nyou have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this \\nunder wraps for now?  I don\\'t want EES to ever think that I\\'m playing you \\nguys against each other, I just want to make sure I don\\'t go back to El Paso \\nand ask questions they\\'ve already answered.\\n\\n\\n1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver \\nthis gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?\\n\\n2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If \\ninterruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm \\nstorage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    \\n\\n3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP \"cost of \\ncarry\" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are \\nthere any \"IN STORAGE\"  transfer costs? \\n\\n4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?\\n\\n5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach \\nproject?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES \\ninject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?\\n\\n6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a \\nbasis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be \\nfirm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  \\n\\n7.  If possible, can EES \"pick\" an alternate delivery point as our primary \\npoint of delivery for this project? \\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be in touch on Thursday.

The \\ndesired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side \\nof the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    \\nIt is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the \\nTCPL/Niagara system.\\n\\n3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) \\nsize.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any further questions.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n\\n  Vince, \\n\\nMr. Horn\\'s request has been taken care of.

If the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as \\nintensely cold as today\\'s and the present hint at another Arctic blast to \\ndirectly at the East Coast next weekend continues then we could approach \\n$10.  Pretty risky business here being short or long, eh?\\n\\nA frozen precip event in the Deep South and Houston is not unlikely next \\nweek.The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the \\nFort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave \\nFairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie \\nWeldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final \\nengineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall \\nruntime assumptions.)\\n\\n1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is \\nexpected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron\\'s 200 MW are \\ndispatched as are Ft. Pierce\\'s 82MW.\\n\\n2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running \\n200 MW for 16 hours per day at our \"bought-down\" heat rate of 6690.  This \\nequals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in \\nonly a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly \\ncapacity requirements:\\n\\n\\n   MONTH\\tTotal Capacity Needed By Enron\\tFt.

Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas \\nrequirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is \\ndispatched in the summer.\\n\\n4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to \\nrun 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus \\nleaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This \\nequates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only \\n16 hours (6% per hour)\\n\\n5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused \\ncapacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month \\nas summarized in the table below.\\n\\n6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running \\n282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities \\navailable from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will \\ncome from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n   MONTH\\tTotal Capacity Needed By Enron\\tFt.

TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -\\nwith those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the\\nstorm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13\\npercent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.\\n           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at\\nweather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,\\ndelivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over\\ntwice the average December monthly rating to date.\\n           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market\\nratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also\\nwas within the top 10.Keep trying.  We are definitely interested.  How much does a pair of tickets \\nto an inaugural ball run?In the case of the Texas Society Ball, it would be cheaper to join for $20 \\nand buy the tickets for $125.

I imagine \\n(hope) that the other balls are comparable.\\n\\nI found several airline quotes for ~$250 as you indicated. Had a great time this weekend.  I\\'m sure glad that Travis got another good \\nbuck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the \\nnext deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty \\npossible next year.\\n\\nI was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her \\npainting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she \"owed\" her but nothing more \\nthan that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that \\nshe would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the \\nmoney.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and \\nMelissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this \\nweek as well.   If you haven\\'t already, I\\'m sure that you can broach the \\nsubject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.\\n\\nAnyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she \\nwasn\\'t able to \"prove\" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  \\nShe still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not \\nworking outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our \\nhouse clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of \\nthings to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If \\nthere is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on \\nthese jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good \\nChristmas for everyone.\\n\\nAnyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There \\nis no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can \\nhelp keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I\\'m sure you see \\nmy point of view here.\\n\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nCharlie If we can\\'t get Wilkerson, Hightower (both Top 5 nationally) and a decommit \\nor two from Texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are \\nindeed pathetic salesmen.

I know the \\nanswers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the \\nrest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let\\'s discuss if \\nyou have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this \\nunder wraps for now?  I don\\'t want EES to ever think that I\\'m playing you \\nguys against each other, I just want to make sure I don\\'t go back to El Paso \\nand ask questions they\\'ve already answered.\\n\\n\\n1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver \\nthis gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?\\n\\n2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If \\ninterruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm \\nstorage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    \\n\\n3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP \"cost of \\ncarry\" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are \\nthere any \"IN STORAGE\"  transfer costs? \\n\\n4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?\\n\\n5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach \\nproject?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES \\ninject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?\\n\\n6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a \\nbasis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be \\nfirm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  \\n\\n7.  If possible, can EES \"pick\" an alternate delivery point as our primary \\npoint of delivery for this project? \\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be in touch on Thursday.

The fundamentals for anything PC related \\ngoing forward are the worse they have been in 5 years or more. http://www.infoxpress.com/reviewtracker/reprints.asp?page_id=814John,\\n\\nAttached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas \\n(9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.\\n\\nThe bid as of Tuesday\\'s closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the \\nfollowing assumptions:\\n\\n1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the \\nCGPR-Niagara curve.\\n\\n2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The \\ndesired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side \\nof the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    \\nIt is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the \\nTCPL/Niagara system.\\n\\n3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) \\nsize.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any further questions.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n\\n  The best summary of what is going on here that I have read recently:\\n\\nhttp://www.infoxpress.com/reviewtracker/reprints.asp?page_id=814The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the \\nFort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave \\nFairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie \\nWeldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final \\nengineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall \\nruntime assumptions.)\\n\\n1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is \\nexpected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron\\'s 200 MW are \\ndispatched as are Ft. Pierce\\'s 82MW.\\n\\n2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running \\n200 MW for 16 hours per day at our \"bought-down\" heat rate of 6690.  This \\nequals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in \\nonly a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly \\ncapacity requirements:\\n\\n\\n   MONTH\\tTotal Capacity Needed By Enron\\tFt. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)\\tPhase VI Capacity \\t\\nCapacity From East Desk\\nMay\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\nJune\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\nJuly\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\nAugust\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\nSeptember\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\n\\n  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity \\nfrom the East Desk.\\n\\n3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas \\nrequirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is \\ndispatched in the summer.\\n\\n4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to \\nrun 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus \\nleaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This \\nequates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only \\n16 hours (6% per hour)\\n\\n5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused \\ncapacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month \\nas summarized in the table below.\\n\\n6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running \\n282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities \\navailable from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will \\ncome from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n   MONTH\\tTotal Capacity Needed By Enron\\tFt.

I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the \\nnext deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty \\npossible next year.\\n\\nI was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her \\npainting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she \"owed\" her but nothing more \\nthan that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that \\nshe would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the \\nmoney.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and \\nMelissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this \\nweek as well.   If you haven\\'t already, I\\'m sure that you can broach the \\nsubject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.\\n\\nAnyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she \\nwasn\\'t able to \"prove\" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  \\nShe still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not \\nworking outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our \\nhouse clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of \\nthings to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If \\nthere is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on \\nthese jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good \\nChristmas for everyone.\\n\\nAnyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There \\nis no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can \\nhelp keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I\\'m sure you see \\nmy point of view here.\\n\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nCharlie Todd,\\n\\nThanks for the info.  I may need some help decoding the info so we can get \\nexact durations for warnings.  However, I think we should wait until we get a \\ngenuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more \\ntime on this.

A PEG of ~1 \\non a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great \\nmarket position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, \\nright?  What\\'s your view?\\n\\nThe technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this \\nis a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got \\nthe brakes on now (too much) but wouldn\\'t you expect the market to begin \\npricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high \\ngrowth in technology?

This \\ncould be a \"buy while there is blood in the streets\" opportunity.Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around \\nagain yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that \\nsent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of \\n$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. \\nThe pullback doesn\\'t appear to be company-specific exactly, although the \\nrumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering \\naftershocks\\n throughout the U.S. energy community. \\n\\nAs we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California \\nhas rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and \\nthe uncertain \\nprofit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing \\nsufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. \\n\\nThe state\\'s two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, \\nBoards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are \\nfacing the\\n prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity \\npurchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge \\ntheir customers\\n for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the \\ngradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. \\n\\nThe risks to Enron are two-fold. \\n\\nFor one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the \\nstate\\'s major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the \\ncompany does\\n operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a \\nconsiderable degree because of Enron\\'s size, strength, and diversified global \\nrevenue\\n streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default \\npayees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the \\nregion. \\n\\nMore significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may \\npull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis \\nabates. Some also\\n fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as \\nregulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended \\neconomic consequences. \\n\\nNeither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was \\nderegulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination \\nalong the way. And a \\nstrong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have \\npressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. \\n\\nThe California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best \\ncourse of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E \\nand Edison\\'s\\n ultimate fate, the state\\'s energy consumers will likely absorb much of the \\nburden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. \\n\\nEnron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks \\non the heels of the Federal Reserve\\'s unexpected interest-rate cuts last \\nweek. The initial\\n euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts \\nwill serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic \\neconomic\\n growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, \\nwe expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized \\ndefensive plays\\n like Enron. \\n\\nWe would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron\\'s favor have been \\noverlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was\\n 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in \\nthe past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly \\nin natural \\ngas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an \\nenvironment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. \\n\\nIn addition, Enron\\'s diversification into still more new avenues of growth \\nhelp to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the \\nfuture. The \\nmarkets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and \\nEnron\\'s broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next \\nyear.\\nAn eventual inflection point in the groups\\' profitability would serve to send \\nprofits measurably higher in the long term. \\n\\nDespite the recent turmoil, Enron\\'s consensus earnings estimate for 2001, \\naccording to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. \\nAlthough the \\nstock\\'s rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term \\nvolatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the \\nmarket \\napproves of Enron\\'s maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going \\nforward\\n 713-345-7229Try author Harry S.

To Skilling, its=\\n=20\\nhaughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy=\\n=20\\nmarkets=20\\nwere highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron\\'s three=\\n=20\\ncommodity-trading floors =01* the company\\'s nerve centers, where it buys an=\\nd=20\\nsells products=20\\nranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20\\noften casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=\\n=20\\ntraders. \"That\\'s=20\\nhow you find out what\\'s going on,\" he says.\\n\\nSkilling doesn\\'t think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=\\nt=20\\nlike an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=\\n=20\\nonline\\n presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=\\ng=20\\nto capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=\\n=20\\nand electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20\\nindustries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20\\ninsatiable demand,=20\\nhas jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=\\n=20\\ntheir customers. That suits Enron just fine.\\n\\nNew Economy Initiatives\\nThe company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=\\n=20\\nits regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation\\'s largest buyer\\n and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=\\n=20\\ntrading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=\\ns=20\\nreally electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron\\'s new-economy=\\n=20\\ninitiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=\\nng=20\\nsystem, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=\\n=20\\nmore than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20\\nNext it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=\\n=20\\ndelivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading\\n bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20\\nmillion in revenue for the first nine months of this year.\\n\\nAlthough energy remains Enron\\'s main source of revenue and earnings,=20\\nmanagement believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=\\nap\\n into new markets. \"In five years, we will be a substantially different=20\\ncompany,\" says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. \"Underlying=20\\neverything we=20\\ndo is the ability to make markets more efficient.\" Along with bandwidth,=20\\nEnron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=\\ns=20\\ntrading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=\\n=20\\nand data storage. \"Trading is the ultimate scalable concept,\" adds Skilling=\\n.=20\\n\"We\\'re\\n using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20\\npotential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited.\"\\n\\nInvestors have bought into Enron\\'s vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=\\nh=20\\nat a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=\\ne=20\\nbig\\n question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20\\nEnron\\'s stock price and what happens if the company\\'s broadband strategy=20\\ndoesn\\'t=20\\nunfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.\\n\\n\"We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20\\nsuited for the changing economy.\"\\n=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron\\n\\nCompany Culture\\nEnron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20\\nmanagement down, employees have little doubt that they\\'re creating=20\\nrevolutionary\\n new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20\\nEnron\\'s headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20\\nticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron\\'s stock price.\\n\\nManagement\\nKen Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=\\n=20\\nthe company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=\\n=20\\nwhere he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=\\n=20\\nforces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being\\nderegulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=\\nes=20\\ncould charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=\\ns.=20\\nBut=20\\nwith deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=\\n=20\\nand consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The\\n new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =\\na=20\\ntrading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=\\n=20\\nprocess with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=\\n=20\\nin the 1990s.\\n\\nLay has long been hailed as Enron\\'s visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=\\nh.=20\\n\"Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I\\'ve ever known,\" sa=\\nys=20\\nLay,=20\\nwho began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20\\nconsultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. \"I\\'ve made it clea=\\nr=20\\nfor\\n some time that he\\'s my successor.\" The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=\\ny=20\\njoined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when\\n describing the company\\'s business. Lay\\'s language is slightly less colorfu=\\nl=20\\nbut no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron\\'s future.\\n\\nLay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20\\nbottom. \"We\\'ve flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=\\nd=20\\ndeveloped a culture to take risks and try new ideas,\" Lay says. Take Michae=\\nl=20\\nMoulton, 30, who is working in Enron\\'s pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=\\n=20\\ncame up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=\\nt=20\\nbegins its operations later this year, he will run it.\\n\\nWholesale Energy\\nDespite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=\\n=20\\nstill at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=\\n=20\\nyear,=20\\nnearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20\\nenergy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20\\nrisk-management=20\\nproducts for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=\\nom=20\\nits own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=\\n=20\\nbought=20\\nfrom other energy producers with excess capacity.\\n\\nThe company\\'s trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20\\nEnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=\\n=20\\nMargins\\n are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =\\nof=20\\nelectricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn\\'t doing trades just=\\n=20\\nto=20\\nmake money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =\\nit=20\\nto package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20\\ncontracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=\\n=20\\nprincipal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=\\n=20\\nthe product,=20\\nbe it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20\\nwholesale energy business average one to three percent.\\n\\nTrading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=\\nr=20\\nthan Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=\\nce=20\\nmoves. \"Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20\\nmodeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20\\nthroughout=20\\nthe country,\" says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=\\ns=20\\nwho closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20\\nmeteorologists=20\\non its gas-trading floor to monitor any weather changes =01* from an oncomi=\\nng=20\\ncold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th=\\nat=20\\ncould affect=20\\nsupply and demand.\\n\\nNow Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=\\n=20\\nderegulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20\\nScandinavia=20\\nin the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20\\nmaking markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20\\nstill loom large and=20\\nnational differences present formidable hurdles. \"We\\'re the only company wi=\\nth=20\\npan-European operations,\" says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy\\n unit. \"There\\'s a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it\\'s=20\\ndifficult.\"\\n\\nBroadband Operations\\nThe roots of Enron\\'s bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20\\nbought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=\\ny\\n market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=\\ns=20\\ngas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20\\nbeing deployed,=20\\n\"the Enron mind-set of \\'Can we trade this stuff?\\' kicked in,\" says Kenneth=\\n=20\\nRice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. \"Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=\\ng=20\\ntraded like=20\\na commodity.\"\\n\\nToday Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=\\n=20\\ncarriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest\\n (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=\\n=20\\nsells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=\\n=20\\ncarriers,\\n and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=\\n=20\\nfor a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20\\n15,000 miles\\n and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.\\n\\nEnron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=\\n=20\\nwhich up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=\\ns=20\\ninto=20\\npaying for capacity they don\\'t always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20\\ndemand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=\\ns=20\\nof=20\\ntime =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=\\nf its=20\\nCEO to its offices around the globe.\\n\\nThe company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20\\nmonthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=\\nn=20\\na Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=\\n a=20\\nspeed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron\\n delivered 1,399 months\\' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20\\nquarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20\\nmonths. Both\\n Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20\\nannual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=\\ngy=20\\ncontributed=20\\nin 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=\\n=20\\nbroadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=\\n=20\\n$2=20\\nbillion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).\\n\\nThe other major piece of Enron\\'s broadband strategy centers on delivering=\\n=20\\nstreaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches\\n made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=\\n=20\\nalong with its own internally developed software, Enron\\'s broadband system\\n is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=\\nge=20\\nfrom corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=\\nE:=20\\nBBI),=20\\nwhich this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=\\n=20\\nEnron\\'s network. \"Video will be the king application,\" Skilling says. \"That=\\n\\'s=20\\nwhere=20\\nit\\'s all going to happen.\"\\n\\nOther Growth Drivers\\nSome people may have questioned Enron\\'s decision to plunk down $100 million=\\n=20\\nfor the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros\\' new=20\\nretractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20\\n30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=\\n=20\\nstadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=\\n=20\\nmillion in the process.\\n\\nEnergy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=\\n=20\\nbusinesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=\\nr=20\\noperations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=\\n=20\\nfrom analyzing a company\\'s energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20\\nenergy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20\\ngear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group\\n (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=\\n=20\\nbillion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon\\'s 253 real-estate=\\n=20\\nproperties. \"The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you\\'re=\\n=20\\ngoing to be the leader, you\\'ve got to know every detail,\" says Marty Sunde,\\nhead of the group\\'s North American unit.\\n\\nEnergy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=\\nt=20\\nsometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20\\nin 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=\\n=20\\nbefore interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=\\n=20\\ntarget to=20\\nland $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year\\'s total.=\\n=20\\n\"There\\'s no reason this business can\\'t roughly double in each of the next f=\\new=20\\nyears,\"=20\\nLay says.\\n\\n\"Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=\\n=20\\nbut their track record warrants that.\"\\n=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham\\n\\nThe Competition\\nSome of Enron\\'s trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=\\nhe=20\\nderegulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.\\n Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=\\nnd=20\\ncalled \"Enron Jr.\" by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20\\nelectricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=\\n=20\\nsame goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is\\n much larger than Enron\\'s. A consortium of six energy companies, including=\\n=20\\nAquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20\\nenergy-trading=20\\nsystem to rival EnronOnline.\\n\\nSeveral existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=\\ne=20\\n(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards\\n for companies to find trading partners. They don\\'t actually deliver the=20\\nproduct, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20\\nbusiness,=20\\nEnron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=\\nl=20\\nutilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron\\'s geographic scope.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a challenge to value Enron\\'s stock, because it\\'s such a hybrid. It=20\\nalways seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations.\"\\n=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.\\n\\nWhat It\\'s Worth\\nAnalysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=\\n=20\\nits four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20\\nalso typically value the company\\'s businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=\\nt=20\\nto be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron\\'s income because its business=\\nes\\n are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=\\n=20\\n$80, Enron\\'s pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=\\n=20\\nvalued at $5,\\nwholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=\\n=20\\n$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=\\n=20\\nenergy=20\\nis too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20\\nyear, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron\\'s projected total EBIT. And=\\n=20\\nwholesale=20\\nenergy\\'s EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=\\nhe=20\\nnext five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20\\nmarkets.=20\\nCombine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=\\n=20\\nbroadband,=20\\nnot to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=\\nng=20\\nargues, Enron\\'s stock is easily worth $130.\\n\\nAnalysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20\\nhigher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=\\ns=20\\nstill=20\\na couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=\\n=20\\nBarney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20\\npotential=20\\nof bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=\\n=20\\nmarket could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=\\n=20\\nmid-1990s.\\n Niles thinks Enron\\'s overall energy operations alone are worth more than=\\n=20\\nEnron\\'s current share price. If that\\'s true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=\\n=20\\nfor bandwidth\\n would make Enron a $100 stock.\\n\\nUltimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20\\nEnron meets analysts\\' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=\\nr=20\\n=01* and\\n maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=\\n $92.\\n\\nSocial Responsibility\\nEnron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce=\\n=20\\nmethane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But=\\n=20\\ncertain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant =\\nin=20\\nIndia, have been mired in controversy.

According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).\\n\\nAgain, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.\\n\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\nKim,\\n\\nThe NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.  I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.  I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.  Sorry for the confusion.\\n\\nLet me know if you need any more assistance.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n\\n Per our conversation, I recommend using Tetco M3 plus the avg seasonal basis to Alg CG (Summer =~0, Winter =~.10)  Note the volatility in these that I graphed.  This volatility willl likely need to be taken into account in your model if/when you get to that level of detail.\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n Doug,\\n\\nFax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.\\n\\n\\nThanks again,\\n\\nCharlieI\\'ll sell you up to 2 Jun nat gas at 4.565 right now, same as Johnny.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutlook Migration Team@ENRON\\n05/14/2001 01:26 PM\\nTo:=09V Charles Weldon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ed McMichael/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Boyt/Cor=\\np/Enron@Enron, Eric Moon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Geraldine Irvine/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jin Guo=\\n/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louis Dicarlo/NA/Enron@ENRON, Maria Garza/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark B=\\nreese/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sandy Olitsky/HOU/ECT@ECT, Santiago Garcia/NA/Enron@Enro=\\nn, Steven Curlee/Corp/Enron@Enron, Alexandra Villarreal/NA/Enron@ENRON, And=\\nrea Ring/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brad McKay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sc=\\nott Hendrickson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Thode/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jennifer Walker/N=\\nA/Enron@Enron, Judy Townsend/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kathie Grabstald/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim=\\nberly Bates/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Koenig/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Peter F Keavey/HOU/E=\\nCT@ECT, Rebecca Ford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sandra F Brawner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Goode=\\nll/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sean Boyle/Corp/Enron@ENRON, S=\\nusan W Pereira/HOU/ECT@ECT, Victoria Versen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vladi Pimenov/NA/E=\\nnron@Enron, Craig Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Jones/NA/Enron@ENRON, Frank W V=\\nickers/NA/Enron@Enron, Gil Muhl/Corp/Enron@ENRON, John Hodge/Corp/Enron@ENR=\\nON, Maureen Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nelson Ferries/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Phil DeMoes=\\n/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robin Barbe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ruth Concannon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tam=\\nmi DePaolis/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Daniel Lisk/NA/Enron@Enron, Hillary Mack/Corp=\\n/Enron@Enron, Jan Sutherland/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jason Wolfe/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sh=\\nannon Groenewold/ENRON@enronXgate, Shelly Mendel/NA/Enron@ENRON, Stacey J B=\\nrewer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Suzanne Christiansen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Evans/NA/Enron@ENR=\\nON, Dina Snow/Corp/Enron@Enron, Kay Young/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lance Schuler-Legal/=\\nHOU/ECT@ECT, Vineet Arora/NA/Enron@ENRON, Beth A Ryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Ber=\\nkeland/Corp/Enron@Enron, David A Terlip/Corp/Enron@Enron, Doug Leach/HOU/EC=\\nT@ECT, Marc De La Roche/HOU/ECT@ECT, Randal Maffett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tushar Dhr=\\nuv/Corp/Enron@Enron, Yolanda Cordova-Gilbert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Amy Villasenor/OT=\\nS/Enron@Enron, Debra Young/OTS/Enron@Enron, Jeff Arnold/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Jo=\\nhn Reese/FGT/Enron@ENRON, Josh Mayes/OTS/Enron@Enron, Larry Fenstad/OTS/Enr=\\non@ENRON, Mark Adleman/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Mary Ann Johnson/OTS/Enron@ENRON, M=\\nary Lynne Dix/OTS/Enron@Enron, Mike Thomas/OTS/Enron@Enron, Morris Brassfie=\\nld/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Rinetia Turner/OTS/Enron@Enron, Robert Geheb/OTS/Enron@=\\nEnron, Ruthann Frausto/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Tyrone Brown/OTS/Enron@ENRON\\ncc:=09=20\\nSubject:=092- SURVEY/INFORMATION EMAIL 5-17-01\\n\\nCurrent Notes User:=20\\n\\nTo ensure that you experience a successful migration from Notes to Outlook,=\\n it is necessary to gather individual user information prior to your date o=\\nf migration.

(NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)\\n\\n1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron\\'s 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce\\'s 82MW.\\n\\n2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our \"bought-down\" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:\\n\\n\\n\\n   MONTH\\tTotal Capacity Needed By Enron\\tFt. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)\\tPhase VI Capacity \\tCapacity From East Desk\\t\\nMay\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\t\\nJune\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\t\\nJuly\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\t\\nAugust\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\t\\nSeptember\\t22,300\\t0\\t22,300\\t0\\t\\n\\n\\n  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.\\n\\n3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.\\n\\n4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)\\n\\n5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.\\n\\n6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n   MONTH\\tTotal Capacity Needed By Enron\\tFt.

Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum.\\nThe new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.

The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.\\n\\n3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any further questions.\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\n\\n \\n  Thanks for the link.

How is everything?\\n\\nAs for deer hunting,  it\\'s been really exciting as we\\'ve been seeing lots of \\nyoung and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in \\nmy memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but \\nour hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C \\nswhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr \\nthird largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 \\npoint that\\'s about 18\" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him \\nas he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I\\'m still open to \\nyou going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really \\nwould not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your \\nown.

Investing, One Stock=20\\n=20\\nBroad Horizons=20\\n=20\\nby Jeff Schlegel=20\\n=20\\nDecember 2000, \"Worth\" magazine=20\\n=20\\nEnergy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear=\\nt=20\\nof the new economy.=20\\n =20\\nEnron (NYSE: ENE) President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling=20\\nhates his office, a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company\\'s=\\n=20\\ndowntown\\nHouston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its=\\n=20\\nhaughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy=\\n=20\\nmarkets=20\\nwere highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron\\'s three=\\n=20\\ncommodity-trading floors =01* the company\\'s nerve centers, where it buys an=\\nd=20\\nsells products=20\\nranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20\\noften casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=\\n=20\\ntraders. \"That\\'s=20\\nhow you find out what\\'s going on,\" he says.\\n\\nSkilling doesn\\'t think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=\\nt=20\\nlike an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=\\n=20\\nonline\\n presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=\\ng=20\\nto capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=\\n=20\\nand electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20\\nindustries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20\\ninsatiable demand,=20\\nhas jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=\\n=20\\ntheir customers. That suits Enron just fine.\\n\\nNew Economy Initiatives\\nThe company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=\\n=20\\nits regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation\\'s largest buyer\\n and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=\\n=20\\ntrading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=\\ns=20\\nreally electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron\\'s new-economy=\\n=20\\ninitiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=\\nng=20\\nsystem, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=\\n=20\\nmore than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20\\nNext it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=\\n=20\\ndelivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading\\n bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20\\nmillion in revenue for the first nine months of this year.\\n\\nAlthough energy remains Enron\\'s main source of revenue and earnings,=20\\nmanagement believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=\\nap\\n into new markets. \"In five years, we will be a substantially different=20\\ncompany,\" says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. \"Underlying=20\\neverything we=20\\ndo is the ability to make markets more efficient.\" Along with bandwidth,=20\\nEnron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=\\ns=20\\ntrading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=\\n=20\\nand data storage. \"Trading is the ultimate scalable concept,\" adds Skilling=\\n.=20\\n\"We\\'re\\n using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20\\npotential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited.\"\\n\\nInvestors have bought into Enron\\'s vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=\\nh=20\\nat a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=\\ne=20\\nbig\\n question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20\\nEnron\\'s stock price and what happens if the company\\'s broadband strategy=20\\ndoesn\\'t=20\\nunfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.\\n\\n\"We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20\\nsuited for the changing economy.\"\\n=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron\\n\\nCompany Culture\\nEnron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20\\nmanagement down, employees have little doubt that they\\'re creating=20\\nrevolutionary\\n new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20\\nEnron\\'s headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20\\nticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron\\'s stock price.\\n\\nManagement\\nKen Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=\\n=20\\nthe company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=\\n=20\\nwhere he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=\\n=20\\nforces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being\\nderegulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=\\nes=20\\ncould charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=\\ns.=20\\nBut=20\\nwith deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=\\n=20\\nand consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The\\n new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =\\na=20\\ntrading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=\\n=20\\nprocess with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=\\n=20\\nin the 1990s.\\n\\nLay has long been hailed as Enron\\'s visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=\\nh.=20\\n\"Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I\\'ve ever known,\" sa=\\nys=20\\nLay,=20\\nwho began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20\\nconsultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. \"I\\'ve made it clea=\\nr=20\\nfor\\n some time that he\\'s my successor.\" The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=\\ny=20\\njoined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when\\n describing the company\\'s business. Lay\\'s language is slightly less colorfu=\\nl=20\\nbut no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron\\'s future.\\n\\nLay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20\\nbottom. \"We\\'ve flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=\\nd=20\\ndeveloped a culture to take risks and try new ideas,\" Lay says. Take Michae=\\nl=20\\nMoulton, 30, who is working in Enron\\'s pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=\\n=20\\ncame up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=\\nt=20\\nbegins its operations later this year, he will run it.\\n\\nWholesale Energy\\nDespite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=\\n=20\\nstill at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=\\n=20\\nyear,=20\\nnearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20\\nenergy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20\\nrisk-management=20\\nproducts for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=\\nom=20\\nits own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=\\n=20\\nbought=20\\nfrom other energy producers with excess capacity.\\n\\nThe company\\'s trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20\\nEnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=\\n=20\\nMargins\\n are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =\\nof=20\\nelectricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn\\'t doing trades just=\\n=20\\nto=20\\nmake money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =\\nit=20\\nto package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20\\ncontracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=\\n=20\\nprincipal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=\\n=20\\nthe product,=20\\nbe it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20\\nwholesale energy business average one to three percent.\\n\\nTrading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=\\nr=20\\nthan Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=\\nce=20\\nmoves. \"Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20\\nmodeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20\\nthroughout=20\\nthe country,\" says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=\\ns=20\\nwho closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20\\nmeteorologists=20\\non its gas-trading floor to monitor any weather changes =01* from an oncomi=\\nng=20\\ncold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th=\\nat=20\\ncould affect=20\\nsupply and demand.\\n\\nNow Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=\\n=20\\nderegulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20\\nScandinavia=20\\nin the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20\\nmaking markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20\\nstill loom large and=20\\nnational differences present formidable hurdles. \"We\\'re the only company wi=\\nth=20\\npan-European operations,\" says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy\\n unit. \"There\\'s a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it\\'s=20\\ndifficult.\"\\n\\nBroadband Operations\\nThe roots of Enron\\'s bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20\\nbought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=\\ny\\n market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=\\ns=20\\ngas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20\\nbeing deployed,=20\\n\"the Enron mind-set of \\'Can we trade this stuff?\\' kicked in,\" says Kenneth=\\n=20\\nRice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. \"Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=\\ng=20\\ntraded like=20\\na commodity.\"\\n\\nToday Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=\\n=20\\ncarriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest\\n (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=\\n=20\\nsells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=\\n=20\\ncarriers,\\n and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=\\n=20\\nfor a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20\\n15,000 miles\\n and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.\\n\\nEnron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=\\n=20\\nwhich up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=\\ns=20\\ninto=20\\npaying for capacity they don\\'t always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20\\ndemand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=\\ns=20\\nof=20\\ntime =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=\\nf its=20\\nCEO to its offices around the globe.\\n\\nThe company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20\\nmonthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=\\nn=20\\na Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=\\n a=20\\nspeed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron\\n delivered 1,399 months\\' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20\\nquarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20\\nmonths. Both\\n Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20\\nannual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=\\ngy=20\\ncontributed=20\\nin 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=\\n=20\\nbroadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=\\n=20\\n$2=20\\nbillion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).\\n\\nThe other major piece of Enron\\'s broadband strategy centers on delivering=\\n=20\\nstreaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches\\n made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=\\n=20\\nalong with its own internally developed software, Enron\\'s broadband system\\n is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=\\nge=20\\nfrom corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=\\nE:=20\\nBBI),=20\\nwhich this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=\\n=20\\nEnron\\'s network. \"Video will be the king application,\" Skilling says. \"That=\\n\\'s=20\\nwhere=20\\nit\\'s all going to happen.\"\\n\\nOther Growth Drivers\\nSome people may have questioned Enron\\'s decision to plunk down $100 million=\\n=20\\nfor the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros\\' new=20\\nretractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20\\n30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=\\n=20\\nstadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=\\n=20\\nmillion in the process.\\n\\nEnergy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=\\n=20\\nbusinesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=\\nr=20\\noperations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=\\n=20\\nfrom analyzing a company\\'s energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20\\nenergy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20\\ngear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group\\n (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=\\n=20\\nbillion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon\\'s 253 real-estate=\\n=20\\nproperties. \"The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you\\'re=\\n=20\\ngoing to be the leader, you\\'ve got to know every detail,\" says Marty Sunde,\\nhead of the group\\'s North American unit.\\n\\nEnergy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=\\nt=20\\nsometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20\\nin 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=\\n=20\\nbefore interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=\\n=20\\ntarget to=20\\nland $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year\\'s total.=\\n=20\\n\"There\\'s no reason this business can\\'t roughly double in each of the next f=\\new=20\\nyears,\"=20\\nLay says.\\n\\n\"Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=\\n=20\\nbut their track record warrants that.\"\\n=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham\\n\\nThe Competition\\nSome of Enron\\'s trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=\\nhe=20\\nderegulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.\\n Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=\\nnd=20\\ncalled \"Enron Jr.\" by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20\\nelectricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=\\n=20\\nsame goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is\\n much larger than Enron\\'s. A consortium of six energy companies, including=\\n=20\\nAquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20\\nenergy-trading=20\\nsystem to rival EnronOnline.\\n\\nSeveral existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=\\ne=20\\n(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards\\n for companies to find trading partners. They don\\'t actually deliver the=20\\nproduct, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20\\nbusiness,=20\\nEnron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=\\nl=20\\nutilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron\\'s geographic scope.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a challenge to value Enron\\'s stock, because it\\'s such a hybrid. It=20\\nalways seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations.\"\\n=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.\\n\\nWhat It\\'s Worth\\nAnalysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=\\n=20\\nits four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20\\nalso typically value the company\\'s businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=\\nt=20\\nto be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron\\'s income because its business=\\nes\\n are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=\\n=20\\n$80, Enron\\'s pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=\\n=20\\nvalued at $5,\\nwholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=\\n=20\\n$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=\\n=20\\nenergy=20\\nis too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20\\nyear, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron\\'s projected total EBIT. And=\\n=20\\nwholesale=20\\nenergy\\'s EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=\\nhe=20\\nnext five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20\\nmarkets.=20\\nCombine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=\\n=20\\nbroadband,=20\\nnot to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=\\nng=20\\nargues, Enron\\'s stock is easily worth $130.\\n\\nAnalysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20\\nhigher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=\\ns=20\\nstill=20\\na couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=\\n=20\\nBarney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20\\npotential=20\\nof bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=\\n=20\\nmarket could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=\\n=20\\nmid-1990s.\\n Niles thinks Enron\\'s overall energy operations alone are worth more than=\\n=20\\nEnron\\'s current share price. If that\\'s true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=\\n=20\\nfor bandwidth\\n would make Enron a $100 stock.\\n\\nUltimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20\\nEnron meets analysts\\' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=\\nr=20\\n=01* and\\n maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=\\n $92.\\n\\nSocial Responsibility\\nEnron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce=\\n=20\\nmethane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But=\\n=20\\ncertain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant =\\nin=20\\nIndia, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20\\nprotests=20\\nagainst the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20\\nRights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th=\\ne=20\\nsuppression of dissent and didn\\'t speak out against human rights violations=\\n.=20\\nEnron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000\\n to improve the community\\'s water and sanitation infrastructures.\\n\\nThe Upside\\nWith less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20\\ncompetition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie=\\nve=20\\nthe entire=20\\nmarket will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20\\nexpand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could=\\n=20\\nget a=20\\nboost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:=\\n=20\\nAOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via\\n the Internet. Enron\\'s attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi=\\na=20\\nended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn\\'t one of=\\n=20\\nits strengths.=20\\nSo it\\'s relying on IBM\\'s back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and=\\n=20\\nAOL\\'s Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power.\\n\\nThe Downside\\nThe much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.=\\n=20\\nCurrently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and\\n Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called=\\n=20\\nlast-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving=\\n=20\\nvery=20\\nslowly.

I know the \\nanswers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the \\nrest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let\\'s discuss if \\nyou have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this \\nunder wraps for now?  I don\\'t want EES to ever think that I\\'m playing you \\nguys against each other, I just want to make sure I don\\'t go back to El Paso \\nand ask questions they\\'ve already answered.\\n\\n\\n1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver \\nthis gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?\\n\\n2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If \\ninterruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm \\nstorage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    \\n\\n3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP \"cost of \\ncarry\" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are \\nthere any \"IN STORAGE\"  transfer costs? \\n\\n4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?\\n\\n5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach \\nproject?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES \\ninject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?\\n\\n6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a \\nbasis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be \\nfirm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  \\n\\n7.  If possible, can EES \"pick\" an alternate delivery point as our primary \\npoint of delivery for this project? \\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set \\naside - will this work for you Mark?\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nAndrew\\n\\n\\nI just bought some more CPN.  CEFT has a great 5 yr chart and doesn\\'t seem \\ntoo expensive but I don\\'t understand their business risks as much as CPN so \\nI\\'m going to stick with them.

TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -\\nwith those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the\\nstorm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13\\npercent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.\\n           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at\\nweather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,\\ndelivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over\\ntwice the average December monthly rating to date.\\n           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market\\nratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also\\nwas within the top 10.Keep trying.  We are definitely interested.

Can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system?\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nCharlie WeldonShares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around \\nagain yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that \\nsent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of \\n$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. \\nThe pullback doesn\\'t appear to be company-specific exactly, although the \\nrumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering \\naftershocks\\n throughout the U.S. energy community. \\n\\nAs we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California \\nhas rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and \\nthe uncertain \\nprofit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing \\nsufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. \\n\\nThe state\\'s two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, \\nBoards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are \\nfacing the\\n prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity \\npurchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge \\ntheir customers\\n for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the \\ngradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. \\n\\nThe risks to Enron are two-fold. \\n\\nFor one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the \\nstate\\'s major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the \\ncompany does\\n operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a \\nconsiderable degree because of Enron\\'s size, strength, and diversified global \\nrevenue\\n streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default \\npayees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the \\nregion. \\n\\nMore significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may \\npull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis \\nabates. Some also\\n fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as \\nregulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended \\neconomic consequences. \\n\\nNeither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was \\nderegulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination \\nalong the way. And a \\nstrong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have \\npressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. \\n\\nThe California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best \\ncourse of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E \\nand Edison\\'s\\n ultimate fate, the state\\'s energy consumers will likely absorb much of the \\nburden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. \\n\\nEnron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks \\non the heels of the Federal Reserve\\'s unexpected interest-rate cuts last \\nweek. The initial\\n euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts \\nwill serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic \\neconomic\\n growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, \\nwe expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized \\ndefensive plays\\n like Enron. \\n\\nWe would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron\\'s favor have been \\noverlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was\\n 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in \\nthe past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly \\nin natural \\ngas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an \\nenvironment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. \\n\\nIn addition, Enron\\'s diversification into still more new avenues of growth \\nhelp to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the \\nfuture. The \\nmarkets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and \\nEnron\\'s broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next \\nyear.\\nAn eventual inflection point in the groups\\' profitability would serve to send \\nprofits measurably higher in the long term. \\n\\nDespite the recent turmoil, Enron\\'s consensus earnings estimate for 2001, \\naccording to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. \\nAlthough the \\nstock\\'s rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term \\nvolatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the \\nmarket \\napproves of Enron\\'s maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going \\nforward\\n I will be unable to attend.\\n\\nThank You,\\n\\nCharlie WeldonI don\\'t disagree with your view, but I wouldn\\'t count broadband out yet.  It \\nmay be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.  If it \\ndoesn\\'t then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.\\n\\nBy the way,  I doubled up on JPM today.  It\\'s showed me a profit you \\nknow.....713-345-7229Try author Harry S.

We are poised for even greater=\\n growth.  Even so, we will not be able to fight off the negatives on our st=\\nock and on our reputation right now.  Our problem is not a problem about ge=\\ntting the message out. =20\\n\\n=09Part of the problem we can\\'t do anything about:  almost all equities hav=\\ne suffered this year.  But part of our problem (the part we can do somethin=\\ng about) is that we are faced with too many bad, but true (or at least plau=\\nsible), allegations that we have to deal with every time we try to tell our=\\n story.  These current circumstances are not necessarily bad:  I think we c=\\nan use them as a great opportunity to drive some overdue changes.  But no a=\\nmount of communication or \"spin\" will work right now.  We have to directly =\\naddress the issues.=20\\n\\n=09The difficult allegations we face include:\\n\\nCreative or aggressive accounting (both in reporting and deal structuring);\\nBlack box reporting;\\nOver-hyping of the stock or the prospects for unproven businesses;\\nA near mercenary culture which encourages organizations to hide problems (u=\\nntil those problems have become very big), discourages cooperation and team=\\nwork, and drives off people who demand at least a modicum of civility in th=\\neir work environment.\\n\\n=09I have some answers.  First, I would hold our actions to the standard we=\\n apply to everything else:  the market standard.  We should do the economic=\\nally rational thing in every transaction and business and let the chips fal=\\nl where they may.  Instead of tying ourselves in a knot about managing earn=\\nings or write downs or avoiding an asset sale because it\\'s on the books for=\\n more than the market, we should just make the rational economic decision. =\\n=20\\n\\n=09Second, I would open up our reporting.  Make it as transparent as the an=\\nalysts want; indeed, set a new standard for transparency and integrity.  I =\\nknow we are looking at these things and have been for some time.  I also re=\\nalize that at some levels of disclosure we risk disclosing positions.  I\\'m =\\njust saying we should drive right up to the edge. =20\\n\\n=09Third, I think IR should be all about the facts: disclosing facts and co=\\nrrecting misunderstandings.  I would not \"spin\" in this function.  Our audi=\\nence is too sophisticated.  If we make the economically rational decisions =\\nover and over, the stock price will come along.  We have lost credibility b=\\ny overhyping businesses we haven\\'t proven yet and it\\'s hard to see why we d=\\no it.  To get early credit in the stock price?  I\\'d rather wait.  To prove =\\nthat we are a growth company?  I think a track record of growth and a ratio=\\nnal and circumspect discussion of our opportunities will take care of that.=\\n  I want us to be a company which is bold in its business moves, not in its=\\n approach to analysts or in its accounting.  The reputation I would like to=\\n have with investors is that we never overstate, we never dissappoint and t=\\nhat we can always be trusted.  I am not being critical of our team.  We hav=\\ne the best, most organized, hardest working, and most effective IR team in =\\nthe business.  I am just concerned that we have sent them speeding down the=\\n wrong path.  Similarly, I am not critical of our accounting organization. =\\n We have the finest accounting organization in the industry.  They need to =\\nbe the best in order to get sensible accounting rules and interpretations t=\\no accurately reflect the results of our unique and innovative business.  Th=\\ney need to minimize our tax exposures etc.  I am not arguing that anyone ha=\\ns done anything wrong or ineffectively.  I simply believe that it is time t=\\no reassess how we do these things (and I don\\'t consider my organization to =\\nbe exempt from that same reassessment).\\n\\n=09Finally, our culture.  As I said the other day, there may be a relativel=\\ny small number of individuals who are commercially successful, well paid, r=\\negularly promoted who have little or no respect for their coworkers or othe=\\nr human beings in general.  When others see them rewarded, it matters not a=\\nt all what we say about our values.  Dealing with a few people directly wil=\\nl send a message that spreads like wildfire through the organization.  Addi=\\ntionally, compensation structures and a PRC process which explicitly reward=\\ns teamwork (and which includes broader representation than just the commerc=\\nial groups) will go a very long way toward changing the level of civility i=\\nn the organization.\\n\\n=09I hope it\\'s clear to you that I love this place.  I have poured my heart=\\n and soul into it.  It is the finest organization I have ever been part of.=\\n  Like everyone, I have had some time to reflect lately.  I have recommitte=\\nd myself to this place and to your leadership.  Part of that recommitment w=\\nill be my concerted effort to make things even better.18:07:54 Synchronizing Mailbox \\'Kean, Steven J.\\'\\n18:07:54 Synchronizing Hierarchy\\n18:07:55 \\t   1

kll comments (still need to include all employee memo).\\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n including all employee memo\\n\\n \\n\\n =09I know you are getting an impossible volume of advice right now . . .  b=\\nut that\\'s not going to stop me from piling on a little more.\\n\\n=09I believe everything we have been saying: we have the best business mode=\\nl, we are making great money, we are growing, we are addressing our issues =\\nand we have all of our capabilities intact.  We are poised for even greater=\\n growth.  Even so, we will not be able to fight off the negatives on our st=\\nock and on our reputation right now.  Our problem is not a problem about ge=\\ntting the message out. =20\\n\\n=09Part of the problem we can\\'t do anything about:  almost all equities hav=\\ne suffered this year.  But part of our problem (the part we can do somethin=\\ng about) is that we are faced with too many bad, but true (or at least plau=\\nsible), allegations that we have to deal with every time we try to tell our=\\n story.  These current circumstances are not necessarily bad:  I think we c=\\nan use them as a great opportunity to drive some overdue changes.  But no a=\\nmount of communication or \"spin\" will work right now.  We have to directly =\\naddress the issues.=20\\n\\n=09The difficult allegations we face include:\\n\\nCreative or aggressive accounting (both in reporting and deal structuring);\\nBlack box reporting;\\nOver-hyping of the stock or the prospects for unproven businesses;\\nA near mercenary culture which encourages organizations to hide problems (u=\\nntil those problems have become very big), discourages cooperation and team=\\nwork, and drives off people who demand at least a modicum of civility in th=\\neir work environment.\\n\\n=09I have some answers.  First, I would hold our actions to the standard we=\\n apply to everything else:  the market standard.  We should do the economic=\\nally rational thing in every transaction and business and let the chips fal=\\nl where they may.  Instead of tying ourselves in a knot about managing earn=\\nings or write downs or avoiding an asset sale because it\\'s on the books for=\\n more than the market, we should just make the rational economic decision. =\\n=20\\n\\n=09Second, I would open up our reporting.  Make it as transparent as the an=\\nalysts want; indeed, set a new standard for transparency and integrity.  I =\\nknow we are looking at these things and have been for some time.  I also re=\\nalize that at some levels of disclosure we risk disclosing positions.  I\\'m =\\njust saying we should drive right up to the edge. =20\\n\\n=09Third, I think IR should be all about the facts: disclosing facts and co=\\nrrecting misunderstandings.  I would not \"spin\" in this function.  Our audi=\\nence is too sophisticated.  If we make the economically rational decisions =\\nover and over, the stock price will come along.  We have lost credibility b=\\ny overhyping businesses we haven\\'t proven yet and it\\'s hard to see why we d=\\no it.  To get early credit in the stock price?  I\\'d rather wait.  To prove =\\nthat we are a growth company?  I think a track record of growth and a ratio=\\nnal and circumspect discussion of our opportunities will take care of that.=\\n  I want us to be a company which is bold in its business moves, not in its=\\n approach to analysts or in its accounting.  The reputation I would like to=\\n have with investors is that we never overstate, we never dissappoint and t=\\nhat we can always be trusted.  I am not being critical of our team.  We hav=\\ne the best, most organized, hardest working, and most effective IR team in =\\nthe business.  I am just concerned that we have sent them speeding down the=\\n wrong path.  Similarly, I am not critical of our accounting organization. =\\n We have the finest accounting organization in the industry.  They need to =\\nbe the best in order to get sensible accounting rules and interpretations t=\\no accurately reflect the results of our unique and innovative business.  Th=\\ney need to minimize our tax exposures etc.  I am not arguing that anyone ha=\\ns done anything wrong or ineffectively.  I simply believe that it is time t=\\no reassess how we do these things (and I don\\'t consider my organization to =\\nbe exempt from that same reassessment).\\n\\n=09Finally, our culture.  As I said the other day, there may be a relativel=\\ny small number of individuals who are commercially successful, well paid, r=\\negularly promoted who have little or no respect for their coworkers or othe=\\nr human beings in general.  When others see them rewarded, it matters not a=\\nt all what we say about our values.  Dealing with a few people directly wil=\\nl send a message that spreads like wildfire through the organization.  Addi=\\ntionally, compensation structures and a PRC process which explicitly reward=\\ns teamwork (and which includes broader representation than just the commerc=\\nial groups) will go a very long way toward changing the level of civility i=\\nn the organization.\\n\\n=09I hope it\\'s clear to you that I love this place.  I have poured my heart=\\n and soul into it.  It is the finest organization I have ever been part of.=\\n  Like everyone, I have had some time to reflect lately.  I have recommitte=\\nd myself to this place and to your leadership.  Part of that recommitment w=\\nill be my concerted effort to make things even better.Please see attached.\\n\\n approved\\n\\n \\n\\nFyi\\n--------------------------\\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n yes\\n\\n Thinking of you.\\n\\n Karen - please send a copy.\\n\\n A penetrating exposition of French culture.

We have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing.  We simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced.\\n\\n fyi\\n\\n Packet is on it\\'s way by fed ex.

Our success depends in part on our responsiveness to these observations.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn my email inbox I have a few expense reports for me and John Brindle.  Please review and approve John\\'s.  Please check on mine:  they show that they are paid but on one it looks like they paid double.  It may be that the first one didn\\'t go so they reissued it, but I just want to make sure that it was paid and only paid once.We should get the focus off of \"micromanaging FERC\".  This isn\\'t about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC\\'s approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. \\n\\n I like the \"gerrymandering\" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a \"camel\" and that won\\'t work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California\\'s energy market.\\n\\n here it is\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n What do you know about this guy?\\n\\nI like your revised version.\\n\\nI have placed a call to Barton.  In case I don\\'t reach him, I put the attached letter together.  What do you think?\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nI like the first opening paragraph better.\\n\\nAlso, please don\\'t use the term \"corporate relations\".  I think \"community relations\" works fine and won\\'t create as much confusion with public relations, corporate communications or other functions.  thanks\\n\\n I like Jim to make these calls because he is up to date on the legal community and our interests there.  Put in the request and send to Eliz, then we\\'ll put it in front of derrick.\\n\\nshe might ... might... be a fit in Billy Lemmons group.\\nThanks for your message.

(Enron Wind is one of the many companies he\\'s responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).  I will forward your latest update (originally to Mark Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for Stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension.Here is the most recent update I have.  I have asked our DC office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing.\\nThe summary below is a bit dated (as is everything done before sept 11).

Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the U.S., the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well. The fact that the futures trade on another exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, is immaterial.\\n \\nThe ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Section 5b(d) of the Commodities Exchange, Act, as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA),  provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements, contracts, or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated by the Commission as a contract market for such agreements, contracts, or transactions before the date of enactment of this section. This provision captures all futures clearing organizations that have ever cleared any futures contracts for designated contract markets before the CFMA became effective.\\n \\nDCOs of both traditional open outcry exchanges, as well as electronic-only exchanges, have been approved by the CFTC. Applications by the Intercontinental Exchange and Hedge Street, Inc., appear to be pending.  A CFTC official told Intellibridge that few applications to create DCOs have been submitted since the CFMA was signed.\\n \\nSources:\\nCFTC, <http://www.cftc.gov/dea/dearegistered_dco.htm>\\nICE, <https://www.intcx.com/pressaug01c.html>\\n \\nFor more information on depletion rates, or to speak with an industry expert, contact Intellibridge Sr. VP Kelley Kenyan at (202) 298-6300 x.256 or kkenyan@Intellibridge.com.\\n \\n \\n \\n See attahced\\n\\n\\n\\n thanks\\n\\nfinal\\n\\n\\n looks good\\n\\n A very preliminary draft\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n A very rough (off the top of my head) draft.\\n\\n\\n\\n fyi\\n\\n Attached are some messages to consider using for the upcoming internal discussions.  The document is not intended as a script but as a starting point for your remarks.\\n\\n\\n See revised version\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n Paul Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on):\\n\\nAgenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood\\nA \"white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.\\n\\nLike most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin\\'s \"panel\" on or about Oct 9.\\n\\n  Thanx 4 being so patient!!!

The plan is to make the changes effective 1.01.02.  We need to discuss the communication of the changes.  My recollection from one of our earlier conversations is that this is considered a benefit change and therefore must be communicated.  Is that right?  Is it all employees or only US based?\\n\\n \\n\\n I have a question related to your former responsibilities:  As you know Terry Thorn had significant involvement in the IGU (I believe he is still Chairman).  With his retirement (eff Aug 1) he is asking Ken Lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of Enron.  My inclination is to simply resign the Chairmanship, but there are other options: let Terry continue (I think I know your view on that), or replace Terry with another Enron person.  What do you think?Call at 5:00 today (3:00 your time), if you can.\\n\\n The attachment was scrambled.  Can you send in word format?\\n\\n Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.\\n\\nPlease see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let\\'s talk.\\n\\n I take your point, but to clarify my intent in gathering this information: I\\'m not making the case for a different \"tilt\" to our giving; I was looking for information about the total giving (including individuals) by companies which share a common viewpoint and may face some of the same risks that we face if the democrats continue their runaway campaign of corporation bashing.  Pharmaceuticals were included because Ken sits on Lilly\\'s board and wanted a closer look at that sector.  Ken asked for the information because he is at least thinking about making an appeal to the business community to send some of the same strong messages we are beginning to send.\\n\\n \\nLooks fine to me, but I would change the second sentence to refer to the \"council\" meeting twice per year (as opposed to \"committee\")\\n Looks good to me (I would not invite Glynn to dinner the night before, though).\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nPlease forward to Ralph Reed\\n \\nJerry was one of the people from Mercatus conducting a seminar on financial and physical markets for FERC staff\\n I don\\'t have a role for Tom at this time, but I appreciate the interest.\\n\\n \\nLooks fine to me\\n Ken had suggested that we try to get Schmalensee (sp?) for the October meeting as a substitute for Joskow.  What do you think?My God ... this will be a lot of work.  How much of this can be pushed to the supervisors?\\n\\n per my voicemail\\n\\n\\nI made some modifications, but we may want to make more ... I think we need to emphasoze the reasonableness of our offer.  The audience should be redefined as the Senators, not just the members of the committee.  Let\\'s discuss.\\n\\n\\n Thanks for your interest.  We have asked Cindy Olson to take the lead on forming this group, so I am forwarding your message.\\n\\n JoAnn Hill is on vacation; I\\'ll look into it.\\n\\n Ken -- the process description (i.e. where Brown could play a key role) is discussed in the middle of the update document.\\n\\n Ken is talking to Willie Brown today.  He will encourage him to get involved as a facilitator for a comprehensive solution to the California problem.  Ken would like to have the following information to provide Brown perhaps next week:\\n\\nListing of who is owed how much in California\\nListing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.\\nAny insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists\\nListing of the defendants in the class action suits.\\n\\nThe objective is to identify for Brown what his leverage would be (and what benefits could be offered) if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution.  Please let me know who will take the lead on this.See attached.\\n\\n   Attached are the drafts as of Sunday:\\n\\n     \\nLet Maggie know.\\nI love you.\\nI think you do need to be there.\\n\\n Revised documents (reflecting less definitive statements on earnings)\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n revised with kll comments (still need to include all employee memo).\\n\\n   \\n\\n Just fyi -- Amabile did not present to Enron management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting.

The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:\\n\\nThe employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).\\nTerminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.\\nOur \"contribution loss\" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).\\nLet us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.\\n\\n\\n draft of Ken\\'s remarks.\\n\\n\\n\\n testLet\\'s send it out.\\nSee below.  These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of Davis\\' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).  The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him.\\n\\n I left a message.  Ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal, so we won\\'t be needing these guys.\\n\\n =09Paul Krugman has made frequent negative references to Enron and its mana=\\ngement in his New York Times column over the last twelve months.

Kean\\nExecutive Vice President and Chief of Staff\\nEnron Corp.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman\\'s frequent attacks on Enron (=\\n\"Enron Goes Overboard\" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a str=\\ning of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  =\\nHe reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and=\\n the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks mer=\\nely to entertain.\\n\\n=09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f=\\nree market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy=\\n the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparentl=\\ny rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make=\\n choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the i=\\nntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically=\\n, the example Krugman cites of \"financialization\" run amok (the electricity=\\n market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with a=\\nctive government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in t=\\nhe entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange=\\nles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squand=\\nered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by mar=\\nkets of the many.  So long as Krugman\\'s elitist reasoning prevails, we are =\\ndoomed to repeat such mistakes.\\n\\nSteven J. Kean\\nExecutive Vice President and Chief of Staff\\nEnron Corp.\\n\\n=20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n I got fed up with Krugman . . . sent this out this am.\\n\\n OK if I forward this to Billy Lemmons, or does he already have it?\\n\\nI think #90 might be at the heart of the matter.  If we kept the class size=\\n smaller, we could be more selective, pay more for the higher quality talen=\\nt, make more meaningful assignments, and provide for a more active mentorin=\\ng and development program.\\n\\n We recommended this to Ken and I believe he is very willing.  Should be coordinated with Greg Whalley and John Lavorato\\n\\n I received an auto-reply email from Terry Tang indicating that she is on va=\\ncation and that I should forward this to you.  In the meantime,  I have spo=\\nken to Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO.  He said that he would be =\\nhappy to put his name to the letter if that would improve its chances for p=\\nublication.  Let me know.\\n\\n This is great.\\nRick, Jim and Elizabeth, we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization.\\n\\n David, please forward to the appropriate person.\\n\\nStarting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce Enron\\'s cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these \"first mover\" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.\\n\\n \\nThanks so much; it was a tough week, but I am very proud of how the whole team handled it.  Mark, Jeff and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment, but IR was not pleased.  Hopefully, we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand.  As much as I enjoyed working with Jeff and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership, I feel like the whole place is energized by Ken\\'s obvious competence, calm, and heart.  I have never felt better about working here.\\n \\n\\n See attached.\\n\\nChristie -- please check for accuracy on some of the career milestones.\\n\\nMaureen -- please put on my letterhead.\\n\\n thanks\\n\\nI haven\\'t forgotten.  I have one last trap to run, which I will be able to finish in the next few days.\\n\\n I see my numbers are going up but still not high enough.  Alot of my people are outside of Houston.  Are they solicited anyway?  When we are finished I would like to see a breakdown between my Houston-based and outside Houston numbers.\\n\\n Thanks, Rob.

One clarification:  What do you mean by the sentence starting \"How challenged are we really . . .\"\\n\\n Well, I guess when you lose 80% of your ad revenue you get a little sensitive. . .   I wouldn\\'t say I berated him; it was more like merciless hassling.\\n\\n \\nSee me about this.\\n\\n\\nno message was attached\\n\\n\\nMany quotes from KP -- the Eastern Power Markets Oracle.  On balance a good article.  Thanks for helping out.\\n I believe we have this already.  John B could you send a copy to John S.\\n\\nI think we should find a spot on enron.com to describe management changes.\\n ?\\n\\n\\nLook at the topic below.  Should we send somebody?\\n We are responding.  I\\'m tempted to compare their decrease in ad revenue with our increase in revenue and EPS -- who\\'s burning out?\\n\\n Privileged and Confidential -- request for legal advice.\\n \\nSome further questions:\\n \\n\\n\\nAre we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with \"rule of thumb\" guidelines)?\\n\\nIf we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?\\n\\nMy original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?\\n\\nI talked to Skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the Jones School.  I was very clear that I had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet.  He said he would be interested.  If you would like to talk to him, I\\'ll give you his number.\\n\\nDo we have a time for me to meet with Gil yet?\\n\\nPlease coordinate with Linda Robertson -- I\\'d like her to be at meeting.\\nI know Bob from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.  It\\'s worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.  I told Bob that we probably didn\\'t have anything for him in government affairs at this time, but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the Hill, FERC and perhaps in the Western States legislative and executive branches (if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues).  I am not asking anyone to make extra efforts ... but if you hear of someone looking, please pass Bob\\'s resume along.\\n\\nPlease put a confidential backgrounder re Rod Wright for Lay and I.  I\\'ll be joining he and Ken for at least part of the discussion.\\nDon\\'t know/ havent heard anything re LOng BeachMeeting not unitl 9/24\\n\\n Please discuss with Vince.

But, as Ken made clear we are performing better than ever in our core businesses, our growth prospects are superb, and the issues we face are well managed.  We should be positioned for a great period of growth.\\n\\n fyi\\n\\nHoney, would you post this in the chatrooms?\\n\\n I hope you are enjoying your time in Barcelona.  A couple of requests:\\n\\nCould you give the name of your colleague at hbs who\\'s research you presented at the last Enron Advisory Council meeting?\\nWe are organizing our annual management conference and I would like to bounce some ideas off of you and ask for some recommendations for speakers.  Call when you get a chance. 713.853.1586.\\n\\nThanks.this is what I was talking about this morning\\n\\n \\nrecurring item for calendar\\n \\nHold on.  Dan and I discussed it, but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs.  For what it\\'s worth, I agreed with Dan that to the extent Tom and Ken had reached agreement regarding, among other things, Tom\\'s use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.  But it was clear in my conversation with Dan that it was not my call to make.\\n I think we should have a version which says that \"ken Lay named ... \"  I don\\'t know that the Board actually does the electing, I think Ken may just be making sure that they are OK with his decision.  I will confirm.\\n\\n We still do and you should go if you can.  The next one is in London in October.  Joannie will be handling the logistics.  I am asking Maureen to send you the dates.\\n\\n Do we have an agenda and/or presentation for the meeting with Gov. Geringer.  Also, I would like to see his speeches/presentations and an overview of the business we have pending in Wyoming.fyi\\n\\n Bill -- fyi.  I don\\'t want you to take any action on this until we have talked (i.e. please don\\'t forward this or talk to the people involved yet).  Let\\'s talk when you have a minute.\\nPlease process the following effective July 1:\\n\\nDavid Oxley and Mary Joyce base pay increase to 250,000. (Note: I spoke with our outside comp consultant and reviewed Oxley\\'s situation with the EWS O of C.).\\nMark Palmer (PR) to 225,000. (Note:  I previously asked Mary Joyce to review Mark\\'s position and this is the amount we agreed on).\\n\\nI would also like to review Shapiro\\'s base pay in light of his now expanded responsibilities.\\nI\\'ll do lunch with Sue\\n \\nLetter looks good to me.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nI\\'ve been thinking about this.  Due to limited battery life, calling areas etc, I\\'m not sure that a combination cell/pager is the way to go.  I\\'m thinking that blackberries may be worth looking into.\\n \\n\\n Please send me the latest version of our multi-pollutant and cap and trade proposals\\n\\n OK\\n\\nok\\n\\n I need the following changes to Outlook:\\n\\n I need my file folders to be \"active\" so that I can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when I am working offline.\\nI need my \"inbox\" to show all my messages, including the large messages -- I don\\'t want to have to check in two places (or more) to review all my new messages.  I also need to be able to access those large messages when I am working offline.Let\\'s discuss.  I think we should emphasize, at the outset, our proposed solution.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n Amy Kim is still an open question.\\nI think it\\'s fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.  Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy?\\nI want to show Jeff the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount.\\nI\\'m not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven\\'t worked in the past).\\n\\n I\\'ve been thinking about the need to recast the \"e-commerce\" position as well.  I\\'m asking Maureen to get some time for us to meet (at Rice) in the next few weeks.\\n\\nThis is to confirm my earlier phone conversation with the security desk:\\n\\neffective immediately, terminate access to the Enron Building for Asem Atta.  If Mr. Atta attempts to enter the facility please call any one of the following individuals:\\n\\nSteve Kean\\nExecutive Vice President and Chief of Staff (3-1586); home (713.621.6550)\\n\\nJohn Brindle\\nSenior Director, Business Controls (3-3843)\\n\\nJohn Presley\\nBusiness Controls\\n\\nPlease deal with Mr. Atta firmly but with courtesy and respect.What do we think it means for the pace of reform?  Is it a mandate?\\n\\n This is still confusing to me.  I have made a couple of suggestions, but I still have some questions (see attached).\\n\\n \\n\\n fyi\\n\\n See attached\\n\\n \\n\\n Mike -- how about Lisa Jacobson?\\n\\n \\ncalendar\\n I think you are right:  most people will elect to travel by car, alone or in groups.  I doubt that a bus will make sense.\\n\\n I don\\'t want this going out unless it has been thoroughly vetted with the O of C.\\n\\n I think we will get alot of \"don\\'t knows\" when we ask the questions about what the respondent\\'s companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I\\'m not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn\\'t have time for. \\n\\n I don\\'t think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.\\n\\nFinally, given Enron\\'s focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn\\'t count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.\\n\\nThanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.\\n\\n I want to personally thank each of you for your work following last weeks tragic events.  It was deeply gratifying to see so many motivated, calm, and competent people assemble, organize and get the job done.  As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep competitive intelligence flowing to our business units and management, and make good and timely judgements on issues as they arose.\\n\\n I hope your friends and family are well.  If any of you have former colleagues, friends or family who were affected by the tragedies you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.\\n\\nAgain, my thanks.Let\\'s just circulate the presentation and ask people if they have any comments.  Thanks\\n\\n \\n\\nI think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term \"business unit\" to include business unit or functional group.\\n\\nI\\'m OK with sending this out, but understand that people are up to their necks right now.  we may not get much response now.  We might get more if we waited beyond the management conference.\\n\\n Yes.  Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing\\n\\n\\nfyi\\n \\nAs we discussed\\n \\nI have forwarded this to Fitch.  You should compare with your list and consolidate (or have Gary consolidate) onto one.\\n I talked to Ken yesterday and he is fine with this.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat does \"held\" mean?

It may be worth discussing at the Management Committee today.\\n\\n Thanks for the inquiry.  We do not have an interest in sponsorship.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it\\'s unlikely to get better soon).\\n \\nIn other news:  Melissa\\'s mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.  Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  \"I don\\'t think we\"ll be having sex today.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n congratulations ... sorry to see you go.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n please print attachements also\\n\\n I concur\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nI know this is not technically an employee relations issue, but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before.

I will work on a release today that announces the Tues call and the mon written disclosure.  Here\\'s what I think we should say in the release 1) explain the silence (complex transactions... we wanted to provide clear and full explanations; new CFO getting up to speed; and we\\'ve been busy getting liquidity and meeting with rating agencies etc. ) 2) promise the additional disclosure (monday\\'s written info and Tues call) and 3) list the topics.

Just let me know where.\\n\\n \\nfyi\\n  \\n\\n\\n \\nfyi\\n \\n\\n The Board has asked for a draft communications plan.  Attached is an outline.

Could one of you send him a reply?\\n\\n\\nfyi\\n \\n\\n Linda was assistant secy of US Treasury while this legislation was being negotiated.  Let us know if we can help.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:\\n\\nBrown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez\\' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden\\'s perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.\\nEnron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.\\nIf you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:\\nCongratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.\\nCompliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.\\n(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)\\nWe have responded to the City\\'s RFP for energy service.\\nEES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction\\nThe city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction\\nThat would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant\\'s possession.\\nWe have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city\\'s effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won\\'t play on those terms.\\nSeparately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.Ken talked with Barton.  \\n\\nBarton will not be signing the letter\\nThe leadership met and decided \"since they are going to be in session anyway\" they would try to pass an electricity bill.\\nBarton is now targeting a mid Dec markup\\nThere is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).\\nI got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter).Thanks for the message.  I don\\'t know of anything moving forward as yet.\\n\\n fyi I think the answer is this:  fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron\\'s situation.  These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a \"no shop\" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That\\'s what we are doing.\\n\\n \\nCould you take a look at this?\\n \\n\\n  \\nThanks for the invite.  We will probably still be on our way back from New Mexico (we\\'re driving), so we won\\'t be able to come.  Have a good time ... I know you will.I hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days.

She is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us (around Christmas).\\n\\nThanks for the information.  It looks like I have a sizable additional tax bill.  Am I missing something?  Do I have Enron stock I can sell to offset these gains (e.g. in my savings plan matching?  Other ideas?Michelle - can you respond?  I haven\\'t seen anything.  Also, after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough).  I know everyone is busy, but I would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution.\\n\\n Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.\\n\\n  \\n\\n Thank you so much for your message.  And thanks for sharing that particular memory.  It means alot to me.  I have always enjoyed working with you.  You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.  It made me smile just to see you.  You are an important part of \"my Enron.\"  I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.  All the best.\\n I talked to Ken yesterday.  I had also talked to Linda Robertson.  Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.\\n\\nWho else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one.\\n\\n As discussed.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nPlease prepare the letter to McLarty for my signature.  Please get me his phone number and get his fax number, so we can fax as well as mail the letter.\\n \\nI am terminating McLarty today.  We can\\'t terminate with Kissinger yet.

More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren\\'t doing anything.\\n\\n Here is the electronic copy.\\n\\n\\n This relates to the EPA region 9 issue we discussed last week\\n\\nHas Koenig seen the IR section?  I don\\'t agree with the statement that they have not done a good job communicating with analysts and investors.  I can\\'t believe he would think that\\'s accurate.\\n\\n \\nRick -- per my voicemail\\n I don\\'t think we should require employees to walk around with their badges displayed.  I don\\'t think they will and I think it will undermine the other measures we are trying to take.  Also, I want us to have sufficient additional security to do the badge checks to ensure we don\\'t slow down the \"badge in\" process.  The other recommendations look fine to me.  I have left a voicemail for Greg for his approval.\\n\\n Thanks for the update.  Your approach makes sense to me.\\n\\n FYI\\nAs we discussed\\n\\n Please see attached revised travel advisory.  I think it does a better job of balancing the competing interests.\\n\\n No word yet. I will also be seeing Barton tomorrow. \\n\\nFYI,  I am speaking at his Texas Conservative forum in Austin.  \\n \\nPer my voicemail.\\n\\nI\\'ll be seeing Barton today in Austin and will make these points as well.  \\n I wrote a letter of recommendation for you (you\\'re getting it whether you want it or not).\\n\\n\\n Yes and yes\\n\\n I spoke with Jimmy Glotfelty on Friday.  The message they are stressing is that FERC is injecting much needed certainty.  I think we should add that to our message as well.\\n\\n \\nI would like to see him if it works on my schedule\\n Per my voicemail\\n\\n\\n\\ncalendar\\n\\n \\n\\nI think this is fine.  It lends itself to an outline format, so I suggest converting to Word and make it a one-two page \"leave behind\".\\n\\n Thank you. I enjoyed our discussion very much.\\n--------------------------\\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)Thank you. I enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience.  And yes I am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well.\\n--------------------------\\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)thanks so much for the note.  I remember our trip to Dubuque very well.  My father asked about you many times after that visit we had the evening before our meeting.  I am glad you are well and wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year (I\\'ll be glad when this one is over).\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nI think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.  The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I\\'m not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).\\n\\nThe message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it\\'s a play on the \"health\" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can\\'t keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in \"03 and beyond.  Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).\\n\\nAgain, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work.\\n\\n Please print.\\n\\n\\n\\n Thank you.  I also enjoyed our discussion very much.  Your accomplishments and experience are extremely impressive.  You will be getting a call shortly, if you haven\\'t already, inviting you to our weekend event later this month.  Please come.\\n\\nI believe I sent this to you earlier.  Pankaj is a Harvard Bus School professor who sits on our advisory council.  He is putting together a program (in Barcelona, I believe) and would like an Enron executive to present.  I said I would try to find someone from Enron Europe and gave him your name.  Would you mind getting in touch with Pankaj?\\n\\nI have received my worldcom card\\n\\n\\nfyi\\n We have already submitted our budget for PR, Govt\\' affairs, Facilities, corp HR etc.  Does the process below affect my numbers (please say no).\\n\\n I will bring John BRindle.\\n--------------------------\\nSent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)Gus is in the environmental group.  Most of his time is spent on ENA  activities.  I think he is probably needed if you guys plan to have any asset activity or for orderly wind down.

Call me or have someone call me to identify your needs there.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n  \\nCharles Yeung and Susan Lindberg were not on your list yesterday and so they were let go.  Call me.  \\n\\n Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:\\n\\nThe employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).\\nTerminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.\\nOur \"contribution loss\" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).\\nLet us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.\\n\\n\\n First quote from Greg should read:  \"We see no reason for gas and power markets to become unstable in the aftermath of yesterday\\'s tragedies\" . . .\\n\\nPlease the attached list.

We are not finished yet, but we are on our way.\\n\\n Please see the attached.\\n\\n Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:\\n\\nBrown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez\\' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden\\'s perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.\\nEnron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.\\nIf you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:\\nCongratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.\\nCompliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.\\n(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)\\nWe have responded to the City\\'s RFP for energy service.\\nEES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction\\nThe city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction\\nThat would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant\\'s possession.\\nWe have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city\\'s effort to do a deal with Reliant.

What do you think Louise ?How could they justify going after only electronic traded deals. Wouldn\\'t \\nthey need to attack all deals done ever using a Platt\\'s price as a reference \\nprice ? Good Luck..Let me try and be clear on this, as I\\'m not sure if you are waiting for me to \\nmake a decision on this, or vice versa:\\n\\n1). Energy operations believes, as per yesterday\\'s conversation, that the \\nvast majority of errors on broker trades are caught in the check out with the \\nbroker and end of trading day.\\n\\n2). Enron is currently taking the risk on brokered trades of errors in \\nshowing up many days/months after trade confirmations go out.\\n\\n3).The brokers we are willing to offer this product to are ones that we have \\nhad a long and stable relationship with.\\n\\nHaving said all that I\\'d like to make the following decision:\\n\\nThe margin we hold is to protect for the event that we have a bust with 1). \\nAt Trade date plus three days we assume that any errors the broker may have \\nmade have come to light, presumably through counterparty letting us know that \\nour confirm contained an error, and that any subsequent problems are between \\nEnron and Counterparty. We can ask to have margin cover all outstanding \\ntrades that were generated by broker, but I can\\'t for the life of me \\nunderstand why anyone would sign that, as we are Enron already takes that \\nrisk and we are not even going to be paying them brokerage.\\n\\nIf this presents problems for you let\\'s discuss.\\n\\nThanks\\nAndy\\nI think the broker is never really the counterpart and is introducing us to \\nthe customer, essentially the same as a voice trade. The structure you are \\nreferring to is more of a LME type deal. If you look the structure of voice \\nbroker trades this is really no different, except instead of a phone \\nconversation, there is an electronically submitted transaction.I would like Amita to have the ability to add sub-users out of London to \\nbetter service EEL, if that is possible.

Wouldn\\'t \\nthey need to attack all deals done ever using a Platt\\'s price as a reference \\nprice ? Good Luck..I got this from ICE. Thought you should have a look at it.\\n\\nAZ\\n\\nLet me try and be clear on this, as I\\'m not sure if you are waiting for me to \\nmake a decision on this, or vice versa:\\n\\n1). Energy operations believes, as per yesterday\\'s conversation, that the \\nvast majority of errors on broker trades are caught in the check out with the \\nbroker and end of trading day.\\n\\n2). Enron is currently taking the risk on brokered trades of errors in \\nshowing up many days/months after trade confirmations go out.\\n\\n3).The brokers we are willing to offer this product to are ones that we have \\nhad a long and stable relationship with.\\n\\nHaving said all that I\\'d like to make the following decision:\\n\\nThe margin we hold is to protect for the event that we have a bust with 1). \\nAt Trade date plus three days we assume that any errors the broker may have \\nmade have come to light, presumably through counterparty letting us know that \\nour confirm contained an error, and that any subsequent problems are between \\nEnron and Counterparty. We can ask to have margin cover all outstanding \\ntrades that were generated by broker, but I can\\'t for the life of me \\nunderstand why anyone would sign that, as we are Enron already takes that \\nrisk and we are not even going to be paying them brokerage.\\n\\nIf this presents problems for you let\\'s discuss.\\n\\nThanks\\nAndy\\nI think the broker is never really the counterpart and is introducing us to \\nthe customer, essentially the same as a voice trade. The structure you are \\nreferring to is more of a LME type deal. If you look the structure of voice \\nbroker trades this is really no different, except instead of a phone \\nconversation, there is an electronically submitted transaction.I would like Amita to have the ability to add sub-users out of London to \\nbetter service EEL, if that is possible. I still would like you, or your \\ndesignate, to be the master user. does this work ?\\n\\nLeslie, otherwise it looks good.Did they agree to our changes and send back a signed one ?Actually we got a deal term sheet from them late yesterday, so i guess they \\nagreed to the changes.Probably want to grab both slots. What do you think Louise ?How could they justify going after only electronic traded deals. Wouldn\\'t \\nthey need to attack all deals done ever using a Platt\\'s price as a reference \\nprice ? Good Luck..Greg,\\n\\nI know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions:\\n\\n1). This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms. We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...)\\n \\n2). I don\\'t know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE\\'s market making and trading structure intact and having DYN\\'s asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to be presumptuous but I hadn\\'t talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.\\n\\nGood luck,\\nAndySteve,\\n\\nThank you for the diagram and sorry for not getting back to you sooner.\\nWe are evaluating how Merchants Exchange and Enron could work together\\nand will contact you when we are ready to move the dialogue forward.\\n\\nThanks,\\nAndy Zipper\\n\\n\\nWe will not be displaying volatilities on the web, only bid volume, bid \\npremium, offer volume, offer premium, and strike.I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour \\nand a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on \\nwhere they are heading.\\n\\n1).

They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.\\n\\n4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.\\n\\n5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.\\n\\n6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals.

It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.\\n\\nRevenue expectations:\\n\\nReuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop.

Furthermore who is he ?\\nGreg and Philippe\\n\\nHaving listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:\\n\\n1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.\\n\\n2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\n\\nEnronOnline\\'s auction functionality is very thin. DealBench\\'s has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench\\'s auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.\\n\\nThanks,\\nAZ \\nYes, but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of DealBench. If not, we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going.\\n\\n\\n I talked with Greg and he and bibi are for it. Start the process with Guadaramma but keep it close to the vest as it is not official with the DealBench folks.\\nthanks. \\nWasn\\'t me.\\nDo we want to make this official ?\\n\\n\\n \\nGive Raj a call.\\n\\n--------- Inline attachment follows ---------\\n\\nFrom:  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=LCANNO2>\\nDate: Monday, April 23, 2001 8:39:09 GMT\\nSubject: I do not want my name in the article.

Ideally I would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences. How does this work for you guys ?\\n\\nThanks\\nAZ\\n\\n\\nMy pleasure.\\nClaudio,\\n\\nI agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. \\n\\nMy goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.\\n\\nquestions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.\\n\\nRegards,\\nAndy\\nYou\\'re right he does look good. I am very interested. Can you set up a phone interview, and if that goes well bring him down for rounds.\\nStu,\\n\\nWhen you get a chance can you gice me a call re: the above and Natsource. I\\'m around most of tomrrow so any old time is fine with me.\\n\\nThanks\\nAndythanks.\\nI agree. The whole thing is a sham.\\n\\nFYI\\n any help you can give us would be appreciated. thanks.\\n\\n Thank you.\\nEddie,\\n\\nThanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family. I\\'ll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same for you.\\n\\nAndyStewart,\\n\\nI base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal \"can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? \"\\n\\nThe problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don\\'t view the function as critical to their operation.\\n\\nFor what it is worth.\\n\\n\\nAndy \\nI agree completely. We are the delivery vehicle for Kiodex.\\nI hear Shell....\\nI got this from ICE. Thought you should have a look at it.\\n\\nAZ\\n\\nHi ! thanks for message. I will try to call you on cell phone.\\n\\nLove you mucho,\\n\\nKPD \\nI get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying.\\n\\tI sold 2,000/d of apr/oct @ 3.19, and 2,000/d @ 3.18. Please put these in the ng-opt book, not the jv book.\\n\\nThanksJay,\\nThanks for the help.\\n\\nAndy\\nIt has the  hO numbers but not the Cl numbers.Jay that makes sense and is the right solution, however I floated it by Rob Benson and Dana Davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just TOO much. Go figure. So they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime. The non web visible route is my back up.\\n\\nI\\'ll let you know how it goes.\\n\\nThanks\\nAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.\\n\\nI flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying.\\nSaw Jack Hirsch but didn\\'t ask him about his club\\'s bonanza...\\n\\nHow is yor flying going ?\\nCongratulations on the new job !\\n\\nGood luck,\\nAndySanjeev\\n \\nto be honest this looks a little to convoluted to me. a nov/mar peiod for weather versus a jan-feb-mar basis ? I pass on this.\\n \\nandyAfter some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven\\'t looked at phys or power yet.\\n\\nJust thought you would like to know.\\n\\n\\n sure\\nlet me know when you want to talk....\\nI sld 500/d of cy03 2 3.56. pls book this in the JV book. thx.i bot 1,000/d at 3.175 apr/oct02. put it against the digital in gas-x.\\n\\nthanksThat would be great.\\nI\\'m okay. How are you ?I am attending the Bonanza Pilot Proficiency Program (BPPP) clinic at Adams Field in Little Rock. This is the big airport in Little Rock. The clinic will be run at Central Flying Service, phone number there is 800-888-5387. If you need to speak with someone from the clinic ask for Kathy Tatalovich who is the administrator. I will be staying at the Embassy Suites by the airport. I don\\'t have the nuber now but I will call you with it. \\n\\nI\\'ll call you from the road.\\n\\nLove you and the kids mucho,\\nKPD\"Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant the terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to death. The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for our dead.

What are you using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry? Our helicopters will rain fire down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar. Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them right through your windows. Our infantry is trained for any climate and terrain on earth. United States soldiers fire with superior marksmanship and are armed with superior weapons. \\n\"You have only one choice ... Surrender now and we will give you a second chance. We will let you live. If you surrender no harm will come to you. When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground.

I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold\\'s book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven\\'t spoken to those guys about it. \\n\\nFor the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:\\n\\nAverage tenor: 5 months\\n\\nAverage trades per day: 400\\n\\naverage volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu\\n\\naverage px: $2.7/mmbtu\\n\\nWith 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7\\n\\nYou then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.\\n\\nThat takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).\\n\\nThe next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.\\n\\nAs a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?\\n\\nAndy\\n\\nI think I have to take my son to the doctor @ noon.

I don\\'t know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE\\'s market making and trading structure intact and having DYN\\'s asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to be presumptuous but I hadn\\'t talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.\\n\\nGood luck,\\nAndy\\n\\n There is a lot of confused bullshit floating around.....\\nMooney\\'s are great planes and are very fast.

Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.\\n\\nThanks,\\nAndy Zipper\\nVice President\\nEnron Corp. \\nPlease review the spreadsheet, and look at Daily Deals Graph.Justin,\\nThe traders are free to use any platform they like. I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision. It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara\\'s group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.\\n\\nThanks,\\nAndy\\nLara,\\nYou need to be the master user for the platform. It is EWS policy. Go ahead and get set up and coordinate document acceptance with Justin.\\nGuys,\\nLet\\'s get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.\\n\\nI\\'m good from 11:00 to 1:00\\n\\nAndythanks. damned things never work.\\nmillionth trade: eric graff @ Coral, TCO pool day gas, someone on scott neal\\'s desk.\\nOpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile.Frank,\\n\\nThank you for bringing your team down to Houston to demonstrate the new version of the system. We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let\\'s stay touch.\\n\\nAndy ZipperI\\'ve seen it before. It is Hong Kong Airport and the guy kicked out the crab at the last possible second. He was seconds from riping the gear off.\\nMike,\\n\\nThat\\'s fine, but no LOI is to be agreed without EnronOnline\\'s concurrence. If you want to do something without us, go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go. Bob Shults is contacting Joe in NY as we speak.\\n\\nThanks,\\nAndy Zipper\\nWe will do on Monday morning, but I don\\'t think we need Jay involved.\\n\\nKal will be finishing mine shortly. Please be prepared to do the 3 hole punch thing 20 times. Thanks.\\n Okay, fair enough.

This may \\nhelp you prepare for Thursday.\\n\\nEveryday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this \\nproduction is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily \\nload is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than \\n55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal \\ndifferences in load.\\n\\nTexas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However \\nthese states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume \\nmore gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the \\nregional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and \\nmove gas to the areas of greatest demand.\\n\\nOur goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if \\nthe daily production is growing or shrinking.  \\n\\nVery simplistic, but maybe it helps.\\nHunterI don\\'t remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on \\nSaturday morning.\\n\\nThank You\\nHunterI will talk to her as welllooks good.  I can not think of anything to add.I am sad to see you go.  Stop by if you have time.\\n\\nHuntergreatThe two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a \\nbasis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages \\nthis product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be \\nselected for index calculation.\\n\\nHunterhas anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would \\nwork like this:\\n\\nChic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable \\ninjection                      .015 bid     .025 offer\\nChic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable \\ninjection    .015 bid     .025 offer\\n\\nI think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a \\ntry.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.\\n\\ncall methanksEOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is \\nEOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an \\nincrease in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need \\nmore info.\\n\\nHunterEOL and Peopleswhere did you get your copy of Green Markets?\\nHunterThe first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for \\nparks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me \\nknow what you think.  Has Laura decided which organization will flip the \\ndeals?Please call me (34772).   Where did you obtain your information?\\n\\nHunterShould we have an explanation of index calculation?  It may build more trust \\nin the numbers.The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three \\ndecimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make \\nthe basis column more straight? Has someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterI would like to see the composite.  I think my home computer has logon access \\nthrough the firewall.I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the \\nproduct the index or product description in the index page.  I think the \\nindex calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the \\nindex page be calculated and posted?Before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days.  We need to \\nfeel confident that the index is calculating correctly.  You can reach me at \\nh-j@swbell.net\\n\\nhunterBrad\\n\\nToday (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she \\nmust be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact \\nstatement was \"If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have \\nanother talk\".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is \\nprobably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define \\nthe exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to \\nleave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.\\n\\nHunterI have attached how I would do it.  check out the red comment marks.

It \\nprovides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed \\ncommodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal \\nto $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is \\ngreater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the \\nspread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be \\n$.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.  The deal is effective 5/1/00 \\nthrough 10/31/00.\\nDonna\\n\\nWhat is the ANSI Compliance Team?\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterColleen \\n\\nWhat is XML?\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterLaura\\n\\nDave Forster from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online \\nand I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the \\nMidwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked Dave to \\ncall you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  \\n\\nThanks\\nHunterI talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If \\nthe Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every \\n\"Midwest Hub\" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the \\nChicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a \\nproblem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura \\nmanages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above \\nagreement.\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterDave\\n\\n \\n\\ncan you redo with day + 1 products only?  Also can you display the data \\nwithout placing multiple data in a given row?  I have attached an example.  \\nThe first row in this spreadsheet is how I would like to see the data.

There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I \\nhad placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing \\nto look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.\\n\\nI had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked \\nfor an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn \\nthe fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group \\nto learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the \\nfront-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person \\ncan sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants \\nfront-end production to be handled by her group.  \\n\\nWe ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It \\nseems to me that if we don\\'t have free access to the website or database, the \\ngroup will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow.I am glad to hear your search is going well.  It sounds like you are on the \\nright track.\\n\\nHunterYou need to get a mountain bike.

I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let \\nme know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late \\nnominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers \\nchanging their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.

Enron Center garage.\\n\\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \\nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis.

All initial parkers will have to use the street \\nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \\nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \\nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \\n\\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \\nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \\nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \\nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \\ngarage.\\n\\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \\nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \\n\\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \\nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Gaskill - Gas Fundamentals\\nLLoyd Will - Power Fundamentals\\n\\nJulie Gomez also has excellent material on gas fired gen\\n\\nKeep in mind that some of our info is sensitive and we may not want the info \\nto leave ENE\\n\\nHunterPaul,\\n\\nIf you are coming to Houston for bidweek would you give my group a quick \\npresentation on future rockies expansions?

Enron Center garage.\\n\\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \\nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \\ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \\ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \\nemployee cost of $94.00.\\n\\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \\nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \\nas spaces become available. \\n\\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \\nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \\nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \\nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \\nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \\n\\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \\nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \\nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \\nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \\ngarage.\\n\\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \\nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \\n\\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \\nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReminiscences of a Stock Operator\\nby Edwin Lefevre\\n          \\nExcellent book on trading\\n\\nHunter\\nBob I will be out of the office Thur and Fri.

This may \\nhelp you prepare for Thursday.\\n\\nEveryday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this \\nproduction is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily \\nload is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than \\n55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal \\ndifferences in load.\\n\\nTexas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However \\nthese states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume \\nmore gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the \\nregional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and \\nmove gas to the areas of greatest demand.\\n\\nOur goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if \\nthe daily production is growing or shrinking.  \\n\\nVery simplistic, but maybe it helps.\\nHunterI don\\'t remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on \\nSaturday morning.\\n\\nThank You\\nHunterI will talk to her as welllooks good.  I can not think of anything to add.I am sad to see you go.  Stop by if you have time.\\n\\nHuntergreatThe two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a \\nbasis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages \\nthis product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be \\nselected for index calculation.\\n\\nHunterhas anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would \\nwork like this:\\n\\nChic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable \\ninjection                      .015 bid     .025 offer\\nChic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable \\ninjection    .015 bid     .025 offer\\n\\nI think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a \\ntry.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.\\n\\ncall meHave you spoken to Andy\\'s book accountant?thanksEOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is \\nEOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an \\nincrease in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need \\nmore info.\\n\\nHunterEOL and Peopleswhere did you get your copy of Green Markets?\\nHunterThe first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for \\nparks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me \\nknow what you think.  Has Laura decided which organization will flip the \\ndeals?Please call me (34772).   Where did you obtain your information?\\n\\nHunterShould we have an explanation of index calculation?  It may build more trust \\nin the numbers.The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three \\ndecimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make \\nthe basis column more straight? Has someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterI would like to see the composite.  I think my home computer has logon access \\nthrough the firewall.I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the \\nproduct the index or product description in the index page.  I think the \\nindex calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the \\nindex page be calculated and posted?Before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days.  We need to \\nfeel confident that the index is calculating correctly.  You can reach me at \\nh-j@swbell.net\\n\\nhunterBrad\\n\\nToday (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she \\nmust be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact \\nstatement was \"If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have \\nanother talk\".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is \\nprobably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define \\nthe exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to \\nleave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.\\n\\nHunterI have attached how I would do it.  check out the red comment marks.

It \\nprovides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed \\ncommodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal \\nto $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is \\ngreater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the \\nspread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be \\n$.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.

I have asked Dave to \\ncall you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  \\n\\nThanks\\nHunterI talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If \\nthe Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every \\n\"Midwest Hub\" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the \\nChicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a \\nproblem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.

Thank you for continuing \\nto look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.\\n\\nI had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked \\nfor an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn \\nthe fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group \\nto learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the \\nfront-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person \\ncan sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants \\nfront-end production to be handled by her group.  \\n\\nWe ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It \\nseems to me that if we don\\'t have free access to the website or database, the \\ngroup will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow.I am glad to hear your search is going well.

This may \\nhelp you prepare for Thursday.\\n\\nEveryday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this \\nproduction is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily \\nload is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than \\n55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal \\ndifferences in load.\\n\\nTexas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However \\nthese states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume \\nmore gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the \\nregional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and \\nmove gas to the areas of greatest demand.\\n\\nOur goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if \\nthe daily production is growing or shrinking.  \\n\\nVery simplistic, but maybe it helps.\\nHunternames for software addition of Hear Me\\n\\nFletch Sturm\\nAndy Lewis\\nRobin Menear\\nPatrice Thurston\\nKevin Ruscitti\\nGeoff Storey\\nSylvia Pollan\\nMartin Cuilla\\nKelli Stevens\\nTom Donohoe\\nJoe ParksTechnical issues\\n\\n1) When some of the members of the chat room begin to talk, their microphone \\nvolume starts to trail off.\\n\\n2) Many of the users use the ctrl button in their daily activities.

I am sending Andy Lewis in my place.\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterwhat is the latest\\n\\nHunterSounds good....marty mare knows where to get them as well.\\n\\nSee you MondayTim\\n\\nI thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may \\nhelp you prepare for Thursday.\\n\\nEveryday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this \\nproduction is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily \\nload is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than \\n55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal \\ndifferences in load.\\n\\nTexas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However \\nthese states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume \\nmore gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the \\nregional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and \\nmove gas to the areas of greatest demand.\\n\\nOur goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if \\nthe daily production is growing or shrinking.  \\n\\nVery simplistic, but maybe it helps.\\nHunterI don\\'t remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on \\nSaturday morning.\\n\\nThank You\\nHunterI will talk to her as welllooks good.  I can not think of anything to add.I am sad to see you go.  Stop by if you have time.\\n\\nHuntergreatThe two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a \\nbasis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages \\nthis product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be \\nselected for index calculation.\\n\\nHunterhas anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would \\nwork like this:\\n\\nChic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable \\ninjection                      .015 bid     .025 offer\\nChic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable \\ninjection    .015 bid     .025 offer\\n\\nI think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a \\ntry.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.\\n\\ncall methanksbook itEOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is \\nEOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an \\nincrease in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need \\nmore info.\\n\\nHunterEOL and Peopleswhere did you get your copy of Green Markets?\\nHunterThe first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for \\nparks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me \\nknow what you think.  Has Laura decided which organization will flip the \\ndeals?Please call me (34772).   Where did you obtain your information?\\n\\nHunterShould we have an explanation of index calculation?  It may build more trust \\nin the numbers.The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three \\ndecimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make \\nthe basis column more straight? Ned Higgins met with Tim Herman on Friday.  However I don\\'t think we are \\ngoing to pursue the project.\\n\\nHow are ya?\\nHunterHas someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterI would like to see the composite.  I think my home computer has logon access \\nthrough the firewall.I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the \\nproduct the index or product description in the index page.  I think the \\nindex calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the \\nindex page be calculated and posted?Before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days.  We need to \\nfeel confident that the index is calculating correctly.  You can reach me at \\nh-j@swbell.net\\n\\nhunterBrad\\n\\nToday (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she \\nmust be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact \\nstatement was \"If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have \\nanother talk\".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is \\nprobably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define \\nthe exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to \\nleave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.\\n\\nHunterI have attached how I would do it.  check out the red comment marks.  Do not \\nadd day ahead + 1\\nI leave for Portland around 4:00\\n\\nThanks\\nHunter\\n\\n\\nnext week sometime is possible.  not Tuesday\\n\\nHunterAny more documentation on this deal?\\n\\nMidwestern Gas Transmission\\n5/18/00 - Midwestern filed notice of a negotiated rate deal with Dynegy.  It \\nprovides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed \\ncommodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal \\nto $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is \\ngreater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the \\nspread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be \\n$.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.  The deal is effective 5/1/00 \\nthrough 10/31/00.\\nDonna\\n\\nWhat is the ANSI Compliance Team?\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterColleen \\n\\nWhat is XML?\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterI have little need for Volp at this time.\\n\\nThank YouLaura\\n\\nDave Forster from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online \\nand I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the \\nMidwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked Dave to \\ncall you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  \\n\\nThanks\\nHunterI talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If \\nthe Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every \\n\"Midwest Hub\" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the \\nChicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a \\nproblem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura \\nmanages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above \\nagreement.\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterDave\\n\\n \\n\\ncan you redo with day + 1 products only?  Also can you display the data \\nwithout placing multiple data in a given row?  I have attached an example.  \\nThe first row in this spreadsheet is how I would like to see the data.  This \\nway I can sort the data in any fashion.\\n\\nThanks\\nHunter\\ncan we create a link to a Chicago Hub EOL site?  If so, can the Chicago Hub \\nsite have new PA\\'s and ETA\\'s?What is ETA and PA?\\n\\nThankswe will need to do it after work sometime.  Let me know\\n\\nHunteragreedI feel like such a heel.  There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I \\nhad placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing \\nto look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.\\n\\nI had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked \\nfor an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn \\nthe fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group \\nto learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the \\nfront-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person \\ncan sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants \\nfront-end production to be handled by her group.  \\n\\nWe ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It \\nseems to me that if we don\\'t have free access to the website or database, the \\ngroup will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow.I am glad to hear your search is going well.  It sounds like you are on the \\nright track.\\n\\nHunterASAP - Tomorrow mid-morning would probably best for me but let me knowYou need to get a mountain bike.

I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let \\nme know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late \\nnominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers \\nchanging their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.  Jason \\nalso thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated.  \\nPlease write back with PGL&C\\'s position on the matter.\\n\\nThanks\\nHunterTrunkline LNG Company\\n5/18/00 - Trunkline filed for approval of a new rate schedule (LLS) for LNG=\\n=20\\nLending Service.

soon.\\n\\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \\nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \\noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\\n\\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \\nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \\ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \\ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \\nemployee cost of $94.00.\\n\\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \\nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \\nas spaces become available. \\n\\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \\nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \\nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \\nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \\nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \\n\\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \\nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \\nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \\nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \\ngarage.\\n\\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \\nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \\n\\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \\nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think I have a meeting at 3:00.\\n\\nCall me when you have time tomorrow and we will set a time.\\n\\nHunter\\nx34772Can we meet on Friday and review this spreadsheet?  \\n\\nHunterMy handwriting is messy so I am sending an e-mail.\\n\\nSlide:      Competitive Analysis Groups\\n\\nHeading:     Chicago Portal: Market Area Newsletter\\n\\nSuggested additions:    make note of a website\\n                                              Transportation spreads \\ncalculated with EOL numbers\\n                                              E-Confirms\\n                                              Customer specific transaction \\nhistory information\\n                                              Log-in ID to portal is the same \\nas EOL ID\\n                                              Customer specific information \\non Enron\\'s nominations with the customer\\n\\nHeading:    Provides\\n                \\nSuggested additions:   integration with EOL\\n                                             Promotes EOL sign-up\\n                      http://gasfundynew.dev.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp\\tTASK ASSIGNMENT\\n\\n\\nTask Priority:\\t\\t\\nTask Due On:\\t\\t\\nTask Start Date:\\t\\n\\tTASK ASSIGNMENT\\n\\n\\nStatus:\\t\\tcompleted\\n\\nTask Priority:\\t\\t\\nTask Due On:\\t\\t\\nTask Start Date:\\t\\n\\nMeet with Richard to create format\\nCall Louise to get process started\\tTASK ASSIGNMENT\\n\\n\\nStatus:\\t\\tcompleted\\n\\nTask Priority:\\t\\t\\nTask Due On:\\t\\t\\nTask Start Date:\\t\\n\\tTASK ASSIGNMENT\\n\\n\\nStatus:\\t\\tcompleted\\n\\nTask Priority:\\t\\t\\nTask Due On:\\t\\t\\nTask Start Date:\\t\\n\\nold deal may have been 5,000 a month plus expenses\\tTASK ASSIGNMENT\\n\\n\\nStatus:\\t\\tcompleted\\n\\nTask Priority:\\t\\t\\nTask Due On:\\t\\t\\nTask Start Date:\\t\\n\\nChicago - joliet markets?We assigned the agreement to Onondaga Energy Venture some time ago, so I would presume that matters pertaining to ENA no longer apply.

Fred previously checked with the gas desk on this because Aquila had indicated an interest to buy out this contract. The gas desk indicated the current value (as of a couple weeks ago) was $800k. Fred, please confirm.\\n\\nThanks,\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173Gotcha.

From Jan 1 forward we will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs, and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with Westinghouse.\\n\\nThe nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, \\'01 exclusive of carrying costs, is $22,947,599. This is the amount that we propose ENA to assume with respect to the turbine. \\n\\nThe carrying cost through Jan 1 to be assumed by CALME as part of this proposal is $2,055,330. This amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by Enron Corp on CALME based upon the payments made to Westinghouse under the purchase agreement.\\n\\nThe continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ENA under the purchase contract with Westinghouse is $1,558,401. This amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract, which is due at commercial operations.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need anything else to resolve this, or if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLouise Kitchen\\n03/26/2001 12:45 PM\\nTo:\\tBen Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:\\t \\nSubject:\\tRe: Europe\\'s turbines   \\n\\nCan you send me a quick email summary of  what we want the CALME trasfer to be and I\\'ll deal with it .\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nLouise\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Billy wanted me to check with you before they move it. If you\\'re ok with this, please send me a return e-mail.\\n\\nThanks and regards,\\n\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173Thanks. I scheduled a meeting for tomorrow at 9:30 AM. I\\'ve attached a copy of the Doyle DASH which I would like you to sign tomorrow (we expect to have Haedicke\\'s signature by then).\\n\\nHope the couple sentences I sent you last night on Onondaga and Doyle were sufficient for the board meeting today.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n\\nLouise / Dave:\\n\\nWe have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding Onondaga as I mentioned in our meeting yesterday. For whatever reason, our interest in Onondaga (through the Cash Flow Interest Agreement) is viewed by accounting as a receivable. From a commercial standpoint, this is incorrect, but at the end of the day, it doesn\\'t really matter. Billy\\'s e-mail below basically states that because of how the Onondaga interest has been classified, we should reduce the $7.9 million by the $1.1 million payment received last week, but then readjust the value of the asset.\\n\\nBased on our internal valuation, and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser, adjusting the value of the \"receivable\" to $10 million (after application of the $1.1 million payment received) would be very conservative. This would net a gain of $3.1 million for Q3.\\n\\nWith your concurrence, I will work with Billy to support the adjustment of Onondaga to $10 million (and therefore the gain of $3.1 million). I will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Louise:\\n\\nI just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e-mail. It seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation.\\n\\nBasically all I want to tell you is that I\\'m here to help in this process, and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular I can help on. I have spoken and offered the same directly to Miller, Calger and Duran. I\\'m not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow. As I think you know, the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term, and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen (as evidenced by the $1.375 million Doyle insurance settlement finalized today). \\n\\nI\\'m approaching you and others specifically because I have 2 years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy experience. Prior to me joining Enron in May of 1998, I was with Kenetech Corporation (a 1,200 employee publicly traded IPP). In 1996 (after having worked as an Originator at Kenetech since 1990), Kenetech filed for Chapter 11. As part of the Chapter 11 process, I was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the Company to be responsible for liquidating the Company\\'s assets. As such, I am very familiar with the Chapter 11 process, and how deals get done in this context. Enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude, but I believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable.\\n\\nAgain, as we go through this process, I just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area, and let you know that I stand ready, willing and eager to take on additional tasks.\\n\\nWith respect to our current deal flow, I also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which I will get to you by Friday (or earlier if need be):\\n\\n1. Transaction list, status, and valuation;\\n2. Site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy;\\n3. Projected site bank maintenance budget.\\n\\nI will, of course, also provide this information to Miller, Calger and Duran.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nBenPlease be advised that Ron has reached agreement on the Doyle insurance claim, which will bring in cash of $1.375 million (including income of approximately $700k). We are pushing to make sure this happens as soon as possible, hopefully within the next day. The e-mail from FM Global (the insurance company) is attached below. \\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Louise:\\n\\nI got a couple urgent messages today from Jody Pierce and Fred Mitro asking about allocation of the group\\'s origination.\\n\\nAttached please find our official list (a copy of which I gave you last week, but I have made a few updates).\\n\\nIn making these allocations for purposes of the PRC process, however, I want to note a couple of things. First, I have listed the individual in the group who worked most with me on each of the subject transactions. Each deal, however, involved many members of the group, and I don\\'t want to diminish other\\'s contributions to these deals. The deals we have closed have been very complicated, and have all involved many months of structuring in order to bring them to the point of creating value for the Company.\\n\\nSecond, the deal sheet does not recognize the significant development milestones we have reached with respect to Florida and Georgia in particular.\\n\\nLastly, you will note that I have left my name off the list. I have done this for two reasons: because I have worked on all these deals, and because I want to motivate people in the group by providing them recognition for their efforts. The specific contribution made by the individuals on this list varies by the skill set of these individuals. Some co-leads have played a more technical role, while others have played more of a commercial role. \\n\\nI will be prepared to go through this list in detail on Monday, and provide a more comprehensive explanation of the listed individual\\'s contributions. I will also be prepared to talk about the contributions to our development efforts that others have made.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you\\'d like to talk about this list this weekend. You can page me at 1-888-876-3206.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen \\n \\nLouise:\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that as soon as FERC approval is received (which is expected in approx. 30 days), the statement below will no longer be true as the sale of our interest in Doyle to Walton EMC will become effective.\\n\\n\"Enron owns a 50 percent interest in Doyle I, LLC, an approximate 350 MW peaker plant in Walton County, Georgia.\"\\n\\nLet me know if you need anything else. See you at our meeting at 10 am tomorrow.\\n\\nRegards,\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173Don:\\n\\nThis sounds like to same offering that we previously received about two weeks ago from Michael Kolman (not our Michael Coleman) of Navigant. Was the offering you received from Navigant as well?\\n\\nFYI, Navigant (again, Michael Kolman) is representing us on the sale of our SW501D5A, and we have frequent updates with him on our turbine as well as other turbines and sites being offered in the market.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nOnondaga: Enron owns a 12.5 percent cash flow interest in this 80 MW project, located in New York.\\n\\nDoyle: Enron owns a 50 percent membership interest in this 380 MW project, located in Georgia.\\n\\nLet me know if that\\'s good enough. I\\'m available this evening if you need anything.\\n\\nRegards,\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173Louise:\\n\\nI\\'d like to get some time with you tomorrow or Wednesday at your convenience to further discuss Onondaga. We are effectively at a cross roads with respect to monetization activities, and I\\'d like to get some guidance.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you might have some time.\\n\\nAlso, I hope the site sale information I sent you yesterday for your board presentation met your needs. Please let me know if I need to do any follow up on that, or if you have any questions on the project status information I e-mailed you for today\\'s weekly origination meeting. The meeting Heather and I had with Williams went well, and I can give you an update on that as well.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Louise:\\n\\nApologies, but I will not be able to attend or call into tomorrow\\'s meeting. Heather and I are going to Tulsa to meet with Williams to discuss a toll off of Midway and Ft. Pierce. Fred, however, will attend.\\n\\nI have the following updates on our Q4 deals:\\n\\n1. AES Haywood - no change in status. Expect to receive final $2 million upside payment in Q4.\\n\\n2. Doyle - negotiating definitive sale documents with Walton. Expect to sign docs by end of next week. Deal is subject to FERC approval, to be requested upon doc execution. FERC approval is anticipated to take 60 days.\\n\\n3. Onondaga - have received expressions of interest from two parties (United Capital and Trust Company of the West). Will move toward binding term sheet within next several weeks. Indicative values are $11 million.\\n\\n4. Midway and Ft. Pierce - have issued investment memorandum to several interested parties, and expext indicative bids in 45 days. Have also bid Midway, Deerfield, and Corbett sites into FPL RFP (short list to be announced late October). Also pursuing potential tolling deals with Williams and Mirant.\\n\\n5. Georgia - have sent Calpine definitive purchase docs for two sites (Athens and Hartwell). Expect comments back late this week. Will also use sites to bid into Georgia Power RFP due this week.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173Louise:\\n\\nAttached is the I-DASH for Deerfield that\\'s being circulated for signature. Please let me know if you have any questions, and when I can have the signature page picked up. We are targeting to have all signatures by the close of business tomorrow.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenLouise /Dave:\\n\\nFyi, see Theresa\\'s email below.\\n\\nI think this will clear up the issues we discussed yesterday. Please let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n\\nLouise:\\n\\nWe will receive the $2 million when AES and TVA execute an interconnection agreement for AES\\' Haywood project. While it is possible that this agreement will be executed this month (50%), it\\'s equally as likely that it will happen Q4. AES is currently under construction on their Haywood project, and as such, they need to get this agreement wrapped up ASAP. Our role in this is to utilize our resources (primarily our consultant who is a former TVA Director) to help AES through the process (and in doing so, we will receive our upside payment of $2 million). We are doing everything we can to reach this milestone in Q3.\\n\\nWe can talk about this before our conference call if you like. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\nBrett:\\n\\nRon Tapscott and Chris Booth are also moving forward with a US equipment broker, Milt Fyre. Let\\'s work closely on this as we should try to avoid having  a number of brokers working the same buyer. Who can Chris and Ron contact on your side?\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nPotentially, but we would need to both repermit the site (air, minor site plan modifications, etc.), and have FPL agree to the equipment change without us loosing our position in the interconnect queue. We will do some further investigation and get back to you.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\nLouise:\\n\\nApologies, but I forgot to mention a couple items on Florida on this morning\\'s call.\\n\\nWith respect to our Florida development book, and the Midway site in particular, we have 4 value propositions that we\\'re working on. We talked about the first one, which relates to the sale of the development asset (with a target gross sales price of $13 million). The others are as follows:\\n\\n1. Leverage site positions to bid into FPL\\'s recently announced 1,700MW RFP.\\n2. Leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power. \\n3. Leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant.\\n\\nOn item 1, we have been speaking with FPL for some time, and we think we may have a competitive advantage (because of the number and maturity of our development assets) to offer a unit contingent contract to FPL, or simply a sale of one or more sites. If we were awarded a contract, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package (a la LV Cogen). Heather Kroll and I are working on this together.\\n\\nOn item 2, I was contacted by Williams a couple of weeks ago. They indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our Midway site. We have since signed a confidentiality agreement, and are discussing indicative terms. As with item 1, if we negotiated a deal with Williams, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package. Aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal, as they are seeking long term tolling positions in the state. I have brought Heather into this deal as well.\\n\\nOn item 3, last week Kevin indicated he has renewed interest in Florida. Duran and I will try to figure out this week exactly what this means.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nSee you tomorrow.\\n\\nBen Attached please find the most recent site bank list for our call at 10 AM this morning.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nUnbelievable. Do you want to talk about Freeman and CPA?\\n\\n Louise:\\n\\nI saw that this was cancelled. FYI, I\\'m in Atlanta Tues. and Wed. next week, Houston on Thurs. and Friday. I can make myself available anytime, except I have a scheduled customer meeting Wednesday from noon to 5 PM in Atlanta. I\\'m in Florida today, but will be in Houston tomorrow.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n -----Original Appointment-----\\nFrom: \\tSchoppe, Tammie   On Behalf Of Kitchen, Louise\\nSent:\\tThursday, July 26, 2001 12:49 PM\\nTo:\\tJacoby, Ben; Calger, Christopher F.; Wiggs, Brett\\nSubject:\\tCanceled: Turbine Strategy Meeting - discussion of strategy for all turbines and planning for Turbines on EOL\\nWhen:\\tTuesday, July 31, 2001 11:00 AM-12:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).\\nWhere:\\tLouise\\'s Office - conference call for Ben and Chris\\nImportance:\\tHigh\\nLouise:\\n\\nWe are presently working with Jody Pierce to get the accounting system for the turbine book in place, and a turbine report form prepared. We will have this to you in the next 10 business days. The only recent news is the sale of the steam turbine for $400k, and that we intend to utilize an outside consulting firm (Navigant) to enhance our ability to get some interest going on the SW501D5A. Lastly, we are reviewing the possibility of having the Ft. Pierce project use MHI unit #3 instead of unit #1 in light of the apparent market interest in units 1 and 2, and the current Ft. Pierce construction schedule which is better suited for unit #3 than unit #1.\\n\\nMike Coleman is putting together a budget and program to monitor (from a technical perspective) and maintain the 501D5A and the 501Fs.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Sounds good to me.\\n\\nBy the way, I was in Houston last week except Friday (had a meeting with FPL in Florida). Sorry I didn\\'t come up to see you to talk more about this, or follow up with Canada. I guess I got my wires crossed because I thought in our meeting and calls the prior week that I was supposed to wait for further instructions before proceeding on transfer discussions with Canada.\\n\\nIn any case, Chris and I spoke today, and we are going to have a conference call with Brett this afternoon. He has already had discussions with Canada on a transfer price, thus establishing the bid - offer spread. Brett, Chris and I have already had various preliminary discussions on the shared turbine book, and how we think we should set it up.

He indicated that, although nothing has been signed yet, that they are working on several leads. Steve Thome (he works for Calger) is also pursuing a lead on these units with Montana Power.\\n\\nDuncan advised me and Fred that the units are on Canada\\'s books for US$38 million, and the asking price is US$39.5 million.\\n\\nI am happy to take these units on as you requested. Fred Mitro and Chris Booth in my group, who also worked on the successful LM6000 sales and pending GE7EA and SW501D5A sales, can be made available to work on a sale of these units. In my conversation with Duncan, however, he indicated his group wants us to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them. We can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on directly.\\n\\nPlease let me know how you would like us to proceed.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenLouise:\\n\\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you. I\\'m on vacation this week, and did not pick up my mail until late yesterday afternoon.\\n\\nBrett and I have been working through our respective groups on finalizing numbers for the Ft. Pierce turbine. I expect that we should have numbers tomorrow. The only issue on this has been to make sure we are properly allocating change orders and spare parts between the two MHI turbines which are presently under one contract. By tomorrow, we expect to have a proposed cost allocation and will then present it to Brett for his review and approval. \\n\\nWith respect to the second MHI unit, Dave Duran, Ozzie Pagan and I have a call scheduled tomorrow to discuss the Homestead project. On the development side, we will know where we stand with respect to local approvals by mid-May. We are in the process of obtaining permits for a facility of up to two MHI 501Fs. At least to this point, our proposed site has not raised the type of controversy we have experienced in Broward County.\\n\\nLastly, I wanted to make sure you knew that we received our final local approvals for our Midway site in St. Lucie County. Greg Krause ( a director in my group) and his team really stepped up to the plate to deliver on this. This project is now one of the only fully permitted merchant peaker projects in Florida.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLouise Kitchen\\n04/09/2001 09:41 AM\\nTo:\\tBen Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:\\tOzzie Pagan/Enron@EnronXGate, W David Duran/HOU/ECT@ECT, John J Lavorato/Enron@EnronXGate \\nSubject:\\tTurbines from ESA\\n\\nAs I see it, the information below outlines our current turbine position.  Please could you confirm that the transfer pricing has been completed between North America and South America on the transfer of the Mitsubishi turbine for Fort Pierce, we will be transferring a second turbine across from ESA to ENA for the Homestead project.  \\n\\nI recognize that there may be a requirement for 2 turbines for Homestead but I assuming that you will come and see me with regard to this before we reallocate further from ESA.\\n\\nPlease complete both transfers this week and let John and I know the numbers at which transfer occurred.\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nLouise\\n\\n\\n\\nLouise:\\n\\nMy responses:\\n\\n1. The carrying costs have been capitalized, and under the accounting rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract.\\n\\n2. At this time, the turbine value is undetermined. While we have identified one potential counterparty (Montana Power), we do not have a signed deal. In addition, we are in the middle of a contract dispute with Westinghouse regarding the damaged generator. While we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position, there exists the potential of this going into litigation.\\n\\n3. Janet and I proposed the deal I discussed with you to CALME in December, but never got a formal response. I have put in several calls to Elio Tortolero at CALME, but have not heard from him for about a month. He advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal. My group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since December.\\n\\n4. This unit was initially an ENA unit, but was taken by CALME (David Haug) I believe in December \\'99 for projects they were considering. I am not aware of the terms of that transfer. \\n\\nFYI, I have attached a payment schedule for the turbine.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.

If there is value to the turbine, then I really don\\'t understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn\\'t own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction.  I also need to know on what basis and against what agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs.

I don\\'t know that we really have \\nsignificant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working \\nsome accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.  \\nI suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I \\nwill think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want \\nto mull it over.\\n\\nThey look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you \\nforward the draft change orders with it?\\n\\nOne point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have \\nus refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), \\nretaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are \\nputting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and \\nsince the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be \\nacceptable to GE.  \\n\\nKeffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls \\nscheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone \"quiet time\" to review \\nthe contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. \\n\\nWe deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.\\n\\nKay\\n\\n\\n\\nHeather / Jeff:\\n\\nThanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I\\'ve addressed this to both of you as \\nsome of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development \\ntimeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:\\n\\n1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can \\nchoose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our \\nexpectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our \\nhighest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a \\nmodification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config? \\n\\n2. Do we need to define the Facility as \"dual\" fuel? It will not initially be \\ndual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.\\n\\n3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base \\nContract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that \\nVEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In \\nother words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other \\nPersons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy \\nsales).\\n\\n4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person \\nto the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice \\ncontemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for \\nenergy sales)?\\n\\n5. Section 3.4(c) Do the \"additional costs\" which this section requires Buyer \\nto pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include \\n\"lost-profit\" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to \\nother Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that \\nthis section make a specific reference, such as \"including any and all of \\nSeller\\'s lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and \\ncapacity sales to other Persons\".\\n\\n6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the \\nPPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the extent \\nwe use an LLC?\\n\\n 7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM \\naccounting given the terms of this PPA?  \\n\\nJeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in \\norder of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items \\nwe\\'ll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs. \\nmunicipal water supply, etc.). It would be helpful if you would use the \\nproject development control matrix.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenDave / Chris:\\n\\nI wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal \\nshould close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings \\nrecognition issue. \\n\\nThe deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed \\nDASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays \\nENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine \\nDeposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the \\nassignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC \\nmember interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice \\nprovided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to \\npurchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern \\nCorp. The only condition to NW\\'s obligation to purchase the member interests \\nis that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If \\nENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a \\nreturn of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. \\n\\nThis structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in \\nJanuary, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the \\ndate of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract \\nassignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to \\nthe assignment and sale of the member interests.\\n\\nThe earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, \\nnotwithstanding NW\\'s firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very \\nminor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement \\nand Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase \\noption with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have \\nhad to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform \\nunder its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior \\nto the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our \\npurchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our \\nagreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are \\nperfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be \\nrecognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated \\nthat we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is \\nno solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we \\nreceive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson \\nthat the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income \\nupon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the \\nturbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to \\nthe second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.\\n\\nThus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any \\nincome form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at \\ngetting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this \\noutcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying \\nprofitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved \\nDASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter \\nagreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income \\nrecognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized \\nin Q2 vs. Q3.\\n\\nPlease advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or \\nif you have any other questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenChris:\\n\\n1. I have not analyzed the TurboPark deal to determine what would constitute \\nan event of default in that deal and at the same time preclude our ability to \\nexercise our call option. Finance / Accounting have not provided specific \\nguidance on this.\\n\\n2. We have spoke to GE. We have advised them of the deal with Northwestern. \\nWe do not believe the acknowledgement and consent will be a problem, and that \\nit will follow the same discussion process as has been going on regarding \\nPastoria.\\n\\n3. NW does not have negotiating rights on the acknowledgement and consent. \\nThey must accept it to the extent the one we receive for this deal is \\nsubstantially the same as the one for Pastoria (we\\'ve attached the Pastoria \\nform to the letter agreement).\\n\\n4. If NW flakes, we keep the $8 million, can sue them to close, and can \\nresell the units. This remote scenario would likely provide us with \\nadditional upside.\\n\\n5. The only scenario that we don\\'t get paid are the two scenarios outlined in \\nmy previous e-mail: we cannot obtain the GE acknowledgement and consent, or \\nwe otherwise cannot effect the assignment because of a default in E Next. NW \\ndoes not have any other outs.\\n\\n6. The income from the deal is expected to be at least $8 million, but could \\nbe as high as $10 million depending on the exact closing date, and potential \\nLDs we may receive from GE. I\\'ve attached the DASH which contains an income \\nanalysis.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChristopher F Calger\\n04/24/2001 10:28 AM\\nTo: Ben Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron\\ncc: W David Duran/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Booth/NA/Enron@Enron \\nSubject: Re: Northwestern Deal  \\n\\nBen and Kay,\\n\\nWhat is our performance obligation to E;Next?\\n\\nHave we spoken to GE re consents?

As such, I want to make sure we are thinking about the duties, \\nobligations, and indemnities among the parties under the circumstance that \\nAES owns the member interests in Haywood, and ENA is continuing its efforts \\nto achieve the milestone of the interconnection agreement through August 1. I \\nalso want to make sure we have adequate indemnities from AES regarding \\nactions we will undertake to achieve the interconnection milestone. At the \\nend of the day, ENA will be focused on two things: (i) causing TVA to lower \\nits Network Upgrade estimate from the current level of $4.8 million, and (ii) \\ncausing TVA to produce an interconnection agreement in substantially the same \\nform as the Gleason interconnect agreement. Obviously, with AES owning the \\nHaywood member interests and being in the driver\\'s seat, they will play a key \\nrole in whether these two items are achieved. I want to make sure that the \\nsame standards which applied to us prior to them exercising their early \\noption (i.e. we were on the hook to use reasonable commercial efforts to \\nachieve the milestones) now applies to them during the period that we are \\nstill trying to achieve the milestones.\\n\\nWith Stuart\\'s concurrence, I\\'d like you to further review the documents and \\nmake a recommendation as to what other changes, if any, we should make, to \\nprotect our upside under the circumstance described above.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aaron Roffwarg\" <aroffwarg@bracepatt.com> on 05/01/2001 06:49:19 PM\\nTo: <ben.jacoby@enron.com>, <stuart.zisman@enron.com>\\ncc: <Chris.Booth@enron.com>, <Kay.Mann@enron.com> \\nSubject: Greystone/Haywood - Extension of Dates\\n\\n\\nBen and Stuart,\\n\\nAttached is Amendment #2 to the SPA reflecting the business terms Ben and I \\ndiscussed this afternoon.

Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting \\nwith the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are \\ntheir availabilities?\\n\\nConcerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire \\nshipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or \\nthe broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess \\nsomeone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is \\nnot a \"replacement cost value\"  policy nor an \"actual cash value\" policy, but \\na \"valued\" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the \\nvalue to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 \\nis the \"value\" of the generator.\\n\\nI await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you recommend we do this?\\n\\n\\nFrom: James P Studdert/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/18/2001 02:12 PM\\nTo: Ben Jacoby/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Booth/NA/Enron@Enron\\ncc: James P Studdert/ENRON@enronXgate \\nSubject: SWPC 501A5D Generator Damaged Aboard M/V INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE\\n\\nA thought.

I previously told him that because of timing \\nconsiderations and because there may be certain agreements that will be \\ndifficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect \\nagreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this \\nproject.\\n\\nI think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should \\nhave more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO \\non their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your \\nschedules on Friday?\\n\\nI also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the \\nMOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky \\nAlex. I would prefer the afternoon if that\\'s OK with you guys, and would like \\n45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise \\non the status of the tolling agreement.\\n\\nKay - attached is FPL\\'s standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking \\nthat Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working \\nwith accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be \\nfamiliar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will \\nbe important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues \\nrelated to this agreement on Friday. \\n\\nHope you both had good weekends. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\nKay:\\n\\nMy afternoon tomorrow looks full - do you have any time before 2 PM to \\ndiscuss the TECO MOU and have a call with them?

It would be \\nsimilarly styled to our Midway - TECO discussions (ENA sells the dev, asset \\nand takes back a 5 year toll). \\n\\nMike Carlson said he would get his lawyer to generate a LOI on Ft.Pierce, but \\nI think we need to get them comments back on Midway to expedite this.\\n\\nKay - have you had any luck engaging King & Spaulding on these deals?\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about these comments at your earliest convenience.\\n\\nFred - we need the term sheet on the toll, and the toll price refreshed by \\nthe desk, as soon as possible.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\nAll:\\n\\nFYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold \\nby Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe\\'s advisor regarding the \\ntransaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I \\nhave a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.\\n\\nFrom an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should \\nproceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the \\ncontracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a \\nrevised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now \\nand then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should \\nproceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I\\'m told three other \\nbidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.\\n\\nChip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH \\ntogether.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I \\nreceive them.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen \\n\\n Attached are my comments on Fred\\'s draft of earlier this evening.\\nOne other item - we attempted to incorporate all the lessons learned from \\nearlier work on the Pompano Developer\\'s Agreement. I hope the attached is not \\ntoo painful.\\n\\nThanks for your help.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n My understanding is no - the actual site plan (i.e. layout, etc.) was \\napproved pursuant to a development order (aka the site plan approval order).\\n\\n I\\'ve been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest \\nby Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating \\nthat the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we \\nshould be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will \\nneed to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if \\nour number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but \\nI think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, \\n2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. \\n\\nThe group\\'s thoughts on this would be appreciated.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n By Tuesday of next week or sooner if your schedule permits.\\n\\n I think we decided to take the turbine purchase approval route, and describe \\nthe several projects (Midway et al) that we can match the turbines with. Are \\nyou still OK with that?\\n\\n Thanks.\\n\\n Anytime after 8 AM Pacific works for me.\\n\\n Can we assume this will also cover Ft. Pierce?\\n\\n 11 AM EST works for me.\\n\\n Have we asked John to turn this around by Monday?\\n\\n We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% \\nprobability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have \\nprojects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and \\nLouisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. \\nThe non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and \\nflip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and \\nhave received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of \\nHartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).\\n\\nI would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of \\'02 if \\nwe do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is \\napproximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium \\nbeing offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we \\nhave a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with \\nany of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for \\n7FAs, although not all permits have been received).\\n\\n Do you want to send the LOI to TECO, or should I?\\n\\n TECO.\\n\\n I\\'m sorry. TECO and Ft. Pierce Utility Authority.\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n Fred still owes comments. We\\'ll target sending the LOI on Monday.\\n\\nI\\'ll call you on my way to the airport.\\n\\n Dave:\\n\\nThanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message \\ncorrectly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can \\noperate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas \\nemissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our \\noperating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at \\n100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nKay:\\n\\nI incorporated the change to the opening para. from your e-mail to accounting \\non 5-31.\\n\\nFred:\\n\\nBased on what Dave says below we should then structure our toll such that we \\ncan dispatch each unit at whatever the part-load MW rating is that GE still \\nguarantees at 9PPM NOx on gas, and 42PPM NOx on oil.\\n\\n\\nAttached are clean and marked versions of our comments to the LOI. We should \\nhave the referenced Tolling Agreement term sheet to you by Wednesday.\\n\\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience when you will be prepared to \\ndiscuss our comments. Thanks much.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a seperate e-mail, I sent out the LOI to TECO which incorporated most of \\nFred\\'s comments. On the tolling term sheet, I agree with Fred\\'s comments. Kay \\n- where do we stand on having outside counsel review this? I have indicated \\nto TECO that we will have a draft tolling term sheet to them by Wednesday. \\nPlease let me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\nAs we are having software problems, I am sending a clean version of the Enron \\ndraft of the agreement.

I told him we needed the \\nconsent executed by the end of next week at the latest, and that Chris would \\nsend him Northwestern\\'s annual report and 10-k.\\n\\nSteve\\'s only questions centered around the ENA payment guarantee and \\nNorthwestern\\'s guarantee. He needs to understand from a legal perspective how \\nthese will be provided to GE (i.e. if both ENA and NW will issue stand alone \\nguarantees). I told him that ENA will guarantee the remaining currently \\nscheduled payment obligations under the contract. He is also awaiting receipt \\nof the letter you\\'re putting together.\\n\\nPlease let me know how we should proceed.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenWhy didn\\'t we have the following language in the tax payment section:\\n=01;\\n.=01; \"In no event shall Payments in Lieu of Taxes include, apply to, or be=\\n=20\\nrequired to be made for Real Property Assets and/or Tangible Personal=20\\nProperty exempt under Florida Statutes in existence as of the Effective Dat=\\ne=20\\nor any date prior to commencement of operations of the proposed Facility, a=\\ns=20\\nsuch statutes may be amended from time to time.\"\\n=01;\\nSomehow this was missed because we didn\\'t follow the Pompano form closely=\\n=20\\nenough...=01;\\n(d) In the event of a termination as provided herein, the City and PBEC shall \\nbe relieved of all obligations hereunder and shall unconditionally execute \\nand record an instrument in the Public Records of Broward County, Florida, \\nreleasing each other from all obligations hereunder.Thanks much for the comments. Here\\'s my preliminary response:\\n\\n1. Done, and will add a definition of Effective Date\\n2. Will propose change to city.\\n3. OK - done.\\n4. Power plants are normally deemed to be factories for this purpose.\\n5. They promise to send us each a card and fruit cake each Christmas (just \\nkidding). Your point is understood, but this is a small commercial point \\nrelative to the overall deal.\\n6. Will propose change to city.\\n7.

Thanks again.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nI spoke to Dave, and he\\'s on board with us signing the agreement. We will \\nneed to have an i-DASH signed prior to the guarantee being issued. He wants \\nus to make sure that the termination section is adequate such that if we want \\nto terminate the agreement prior to the payment becoming due, that we will be \\nrelieved of our obligation to make the payment. I think the agreement does \\nthat (although it\\'s not the best language), and Debbie is adding some \\nlanguage to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep \\n(I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran \\nwants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination \\nsection is sufficient to relieve us from obligations under the agreement to \\nthe extent we terminate prior to the date upon which those obligations arise.\\n\\nWe can talk about this tomorrow. Debbie would like to have a conference call \\nat 10 AM central if you\\'re available.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenPlease see the attached document. \\n\\nWith respect to a call on Monday to discuss the attached, please advise us \\nwhat time in the afternoon works for you.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\nMy comments are attached.\\n\\n\\n\\n My revisions.

I don\\'t know that we really have \\nsignificant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working \\nsome accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.  \\nI suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I \\nwill think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want \\nto mull it over.\\n\\nThey look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you \\nforward the draft change orders with it?\\n\\nOne point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have \\nus refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), \\nretaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are \\nputting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and \\nsince the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be \\nacceptable to GE.  \\n\\nKeffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls \\nscheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone \"quiet time\" to review \\nthe contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. \\n\\nWe deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.\\n\\nKay\\n\\n\\n\\nDave / Chris:\\n\\nI wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal \\nshould close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings \\nrecognition issue. \\n\\nThe deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed \\nDASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays \\nENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine \\nDeposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the \\nassignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC \\nmember interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice \\nprovided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to \\npurchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern \\nCorp. The only condition to NW\\'s obligation to purchase the member interests \\nis that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If \\nENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a \\nreturn of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. \\n\\nThis structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in \\nJanuary, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the \\ndate of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract \\nassignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to \\nthe assignment and sale of the member interests.\\n\\nThe earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, \\nnotwithstanding NW\\'s firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very \\nminor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement \\nand Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase \\noption with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have \\nhad to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform \\nunder its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior \\nto the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our \\npurchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our \\nagreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are \\nperfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be \\nrecognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated \\nthat we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is \\nno solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we \\nreceive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson \\nthat the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income \\nupon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the \\nturbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to \\nthe second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.\\n\\nThus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any \\nincome form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at \\ngetting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this \\noutcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying \\nprofitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved \\nDASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter \\nagreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income \\nrecognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized \\nin Q2 vs. Q3.\\n\\nPlease advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or \\nif you have any other questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenMike:\\n\\nAttached is a form of acknowledgement letter that Coral would like ABB to \\nsign at such time as the Facility Agreement is signed. The Facility Agreement \\nis the \"break-out contract\" for the single transformer (LNL 9517-1) being \\nassigned to CA Energy Development II, L.L.C., in which Enron is presently \\nselling 80% of the member interests to Coral (the parent of Tejas Energy NS \\nHoldings, L.L.C.). The remaining 20% will be sold to them after commercial \\noperations of  their plant. Please have this acknowledgement letter reviewed \\nas soon as possible. I assume there should not be any issue as the total \\ntransformer contract will be paid in full (except for the retainage) prior to \\nthe execution of the Facility Agreement.\\n\\nLastly, it would be very helpful if we could somehow expedite the completion \\nof the Facility Agreement.

Any suggestions?\\n\\nKay\\n\\nWhere are you? Do you want to handle the exclusivity agreement with \\nNorthWestern?Chris / Kay:\\n\\nI talked with John today and told him about Northwestern. I basically said we \\nwere close to agreement on doing a project in Montana for the first unit, \\nwith the destination of the second undetermined at this time. I asked him not \\nto disclose this to the rest of GE until our deal is signed. He was very \\npositive on this.\\n\\nI also mentioned the air filter, and he stated that he thought the LD clock \\nstopped when the unit was put into storage. I suggested that both GE and \\nEnron look into this to make sure we\\'re in agreement before we bring a \\npartner in. He appreciated the suggestion and told me Jeff Darst would get \\nback to me.\\n\\nChris - in the meantime, could you please review the contract on this point?\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nBenFolks:\\n\\nWith respect to the Northwestern transaction, I\\'d like to understand what it \\nwould take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM \\nupon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we \\ntalked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal \\ninstalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, \\n2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I\\'d like to take \\nthis one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. \\nLet\\'s plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday \\nwould be appreciated.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen Chris:\\n\\nPlease send Mike Young at Northwestern an unredacted copy of the Blue Dog \\nturbine contract and draft change orders as soon as you get a chance.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBenThanks Kay.

I don\\'t know that we really have \\nsignificant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working \\nsome accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.  \\nI suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I \\nwill think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want \\nto mull it over.\\n\\nThey look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you \\nforward the draft change orders with it?\\n\\nOne point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have \\nus refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), \\nretaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are \\nputting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and \\nsince the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be \\nacceptable to GE.  \\n\\nKeffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls \\nscheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone \"quiet time\" to review \\nthe contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. \\n\\nWe deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.\\n\\nKay\\n\\n\\n\\nHeather / Jeff:\\n\\nThanks for a copy of the draft PPA. I\\'ve addressed this to both of you as \\nsome of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development \\ntimeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:\\n\\n1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can \\nchoose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our \\nexpectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our \\nhighest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a \\nmodification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config? \\n\\n2. Do we need to define the Facility as \"dual\" fuel? It will not initially be \\ndual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.\\n\\n3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base \\nContract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that \\nVEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In \\nother words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other \\nPersons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy \\nsales).\\n\\n4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person \\nto the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice \\ncontemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for \\nenergy sales)?\\n\\n5. Section 3.4(c) Do the \"additional costs\" which this section requires Buyer \\nto pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include \\n\"lost-profit\" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to \\nother Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that \\nthis section make a specific reference, such as \"including any and all of \\nSeller\\'s lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and \\ncapacity sales to other Persons\".\\n\\n6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the \\nPPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the extent \\nwe use an LLC?\\n\\n 7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM \\naccounting given the terms of this PPA?  \\n\\nJeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in \\norder of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items \\nwe\\'ll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs. \\nmunicipal water supply, etc.). It would be helpful if you would use the \\nproject development control matrix.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenDave / Chris:\\n\\nI wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal \\nshould close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings \\nrecognition issue. \\n\\nThe deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed \\nDASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays \\nENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine \\nDeposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the \\nassignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC \\nmember interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice \\nprovided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to \\npurchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern \\nCorp. The only condition to NW\\'s obligation to purchase the member interests \\nis that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If \\nENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a \\nreturn of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. \\n\\nThis structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in \\nJanuary, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the \\ndate of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract \\nassignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to \\nthe assignment and sale of the member interests.\\n\\nThe earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, \\nnotwithstanding NW\\'s firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very \\nminor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement \\nand Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase \\noption with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have \\nhad to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform \\nunder its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior \\nto the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our \\npurchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our \\nagreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are \\nperfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be \\nrecognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated \\nthat we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is \\nno solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we \\nreceive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson \\nthat the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income \\nupon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the \\nturbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to \\nthe second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.\\n\\nThus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any \\nincome form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at \\ngetting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this \\noutcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying \\nprofitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved \\nDASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter \\nagreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income \\nrecognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized \\nin Q2 vs. Q3.\\n\\nPlease advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or \\nif you have any other questions.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenMike:\\n\\nAttached are executed change orders.

She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with \\nEnron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go \\nfrom here.  She still hasn\\'t signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she \\nis not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary \\nfor the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  \\n\\nI did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my \\nschedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed \\nmeeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before \\nThursday.

There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or \\nthe broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess \\nsomeone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is \\nnot a \"replacement cost value\"  policy nor an \"actual cash value\" policy, but \\na \"valued\" policy.

I don\\'t believe their \\ncounsel will be on the call at 10:30, therefore your participation is \\noptional (although you know we\\'d always prefer to have you).\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\nLorie:\\n\\nPlease put the TECO call on my and Fred\\'s calendar. Thanks.All:\\n\\nPlease make sure you review the attached editorial and voice any and all \\ncomments today. Eric plans to proceed by the end of the day.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nAttached are my changes to the Pompano Agreement. I reviewed the last version \\ndated 4-19 which was approved internally (copy also attached), and made \\nchanges back to that draft where I felt appropriate.\\n\\nThe only section I did not add back in was the termination section. From a \\ncommercial perspective, I think we\\'re better off leaving it out as we then \\nhave in effect a free option on the site (as a developers agreement is \\nrequired to obtain building permits). \\n\\nPlease let me know what you think.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n                      Steve:\\n\\nI have forwarded my comments on the Pompano agreement to Kay, and plan to \\nfollow up with her tomorrow. A commercial point that no one has raised with \\nme is the escalation on the $650k payment. I am not in favor of this. Where \\ndid this come from? Please advise.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nI added some language to the intro of section 1 a that worked last time with \\nHerman. Please disregard the earlier Pompano agreement. Let me know what you \\nthink.\\n\\n\\n\\n Kay / Steve:\\n\\nAttached are my comments. I\\'ve tried to address Kay\\'s concerns below, and \\nagree with them wholeheartedly. From a commercial perspective, paragraph 6 is \\na non-starter.\\n\\nLet\\'s discuss. Thanks.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n\\n Ad valorems do not necessarily decrease as a result of depreciation, because \\nmillage rates and a current years reassessment also are part of the \\ncalculation. \\n\\nHave they asked for this?\\n\\n Attached are my comments on the Midway LOI.\\n\\nFYI, Duran and I spoke to Mike Carlson of TECO regarding Ft. Pierce. Dave \\nreally wants us to push to get something done on that project. It would be \\nsimilarly styled to our Midway - TECO discussions (ENA sells the dev, asset \\nand takes back a 5 year toll). \\n\\nMike Carlson said he would get his lawyer to generate a LOI on Ft.Pierce, but \\nI think we need to get them comments back on Midway to expedite this.\\n\\nKay - have you had any luck engaging King & Spaulding on these deals?\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about these comments at your earliest convenience.\\n\\nFred - we need the term sheet on the toll, and the toll price refreshed by \\nthe desk, as soon as possible.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\nAll:\\n\\nFYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold \\nby Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe\\'s advisor regarding the \\ntransaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I \\nhave a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.\\n\\nFrom an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should \\nproceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the \\ncontracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a \\nrevised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now \\nand then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should \\nproceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I\\'m told three other \\nbidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.\\n\\nChip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH \\ntogether.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I \\nreceive them.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen \\n\\n Attached are my comments on Fred\\'s draft of earlier this evening.\\nOne other item - we attempted to incorporate all the lessons learned from \\nearlier work on the Pompano Developer\\'s Agreement. I hope the attached is not \\ntoo painful.\\n\\nThanks for your help.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n My understanding is no - the actual site plan (i.e. layout, etc.) was \\napproved pursuant to a development order (aka the site plan approval order).\\n\\n I\\'ve been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest \\nby Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating \\nthat the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we \\nshould be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will \\nneed to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if \\nour number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but \\nI think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, \\n2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. \\n\\nThe group\\'s thoughts on this would be appreciated.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n By Tuesday of next week or sooner if your schedule permits.\\n\\n I think we decided to take the turbine purchase approval route, and describe \\nthe several projects (Midway et al) that we can match the turbines with. Are \\nyou still OK with that?\\n\\n Thanks.\\n\\n Anytime after 8 AM Pacific works for me.\\n\\n Can we assume this will also cover Ft. Pierce?\\n\\n 11 AM EST works for me.\\n\\n Have we asked John to turn this around by Monday?\\n\\n We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% \\nprobability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have \\nprojects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and \\nLouisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. \\nThe non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and \\nflip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and \\nhave received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of \\nHartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).\\n\\nI would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of \\'02 if \\nwe do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is \\napproximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium \\nbeing offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we \\nhave a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with \\nany of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for \\n7FAs, although not all permits have been received).\\n\\n Do you want to send the LOI to TECO, or should I?\\n\\n TECO.\\n\\n I\\'m sorry. TECO and Ft. Pierce Utility Authority.\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n Fred still owes comments. We\\'ll target sending the LOI on Monday.\\n\\nI\\'ll call you on my way to the airport.\\n\\n Dave:\\n\\nThanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message \\ncorrectly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can \\noperate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas \\nemissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our \\noperating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at \\n100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nKay:\\n\\nI incorporated the change to the opening para. from your e-mail to accounting \\non 5-31.\\n\\nFred:\\n\\nBased on what Dave says below we should then structure our toll such that we \\ncan dispatch each unit at whatever the part-load MW rating is that GE still \\nguarantees at 9PPM NOx on gas, and 42PPM NOx on oil.\\n\\n\\nAttached are clean and marked versions of our comments to the LOI. We should \\nhave the referenced Tolling Agreement term sheet to you by Wednesday.\\n\\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience when you will be prepared to \\ndiscuss our comments. Thanks much.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a seperate e-mail, I sent out the LOI to TECO which incorporated most of \\nFred\\'s comments. On the tolling term sheet, I agree with Fred\\'s comments. Kay \\n- where do we stand on having outside counsel review this? I have indicated \\nto TECO that we will have a draft tolling term sheet to them by Wednesday. \\nPlease let me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\nAs we are having software problems, I am sending a clean version of the Enron \\ndraft of the agreement. Please e-mail me a compare write showing any changes \\nto this clean version.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nKay:\\n\\nAttached is the version being sent to the Deerfield City Attorney.\\n\\nWhere do we stand with accounting / finance? I will follow up as well.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nFolks:\\n\\nHave you all had a chance to comment on this? I think you all should be OK as \\nwe styled this after the last Pompano agreement. In any case, your comments \\nwould be appreciated at your earliest convenience.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nFolks:\\n\\nI received these from Navigant today, but have not yet had an opportunity to \\nreview them.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nBecky:\\n\\nAny update on this?\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nKay:\\n\\nGreg has Christi\\'s comments on the FPL Construction & Connection Agreement, \\nand he will be sending us those comments today in a marked document. Have we \\nengaged outside counsel to review this agreement? I\\'d like to have a \\ncommercial / legal review fully completed, and then get accounting / finance \\nto comment. I this something you were planning to have Carlos to work on \\ngiven his recent work on ComEd and Ameren?\\n\\nPlease let me know. Thanks.\\n\\nAttached is the original generic form of FPL Connection and Construction \\nAgreement for your reference.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n\\nBecky:\\n\\nIn response to the second point below, the substation will be owned by FPL. \\nWe do not view that as a result of interconnection that there would be any \\nliabilities with respect to the FPL system. I would definately like for you \\nto have your legal counsel review the agreement, however, on this point, and \\nwould like any other legal / commercial comments at your earliest \\nconveneince. We plan to meet with FPL early next week on this agreement, and \\nwould of course like to incorporate TECO\\'s comments as well.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nFYI, see below re the LOI. Are you available?\\n\\n\\nSee attached letter which was sent today to Navigant.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\nI thought this was interesting...\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010605/n05298971.htmlOK. I\\'ll forward you the agreement with her comments. My only concern is that \\nI want to make sure we don\\'t miss any points that could affect the \\nfinanceability / market value. We previously had some folks at A&K look at \\nIA\\'s when we were doing the peakers. It might be worth asking Stuart if any \\nmajor points came up as a result of this...\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nI\\'d like to hold payment on this invoice until we receive the consent from \\nGE. Any update?\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nHere\\'s another copy...\\n\\nPlease send me an electronic copy of the document provided to the city \\nattorney on Monday. Thanks.\\n\\nBenFYI, attached is a copy of the agreement provided to Deerfield\\'s city \\nattorney.\\n\\n Becky:\\n\\nWe will plan to be available. Would you like us to arrange for a call in \\nnumber (the Enron folks participating will be in several locations)? Please \\nlet me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nI talked with Steve today about the Blue Dog deal. I told him we needed the \\nconsent executed by the end of next week at the latest, and that Chris would \\nsend him Northwestern\\'s annual report and 10-k.\\n\\nSteve\\'s only questions centered around the ENA payment guarantee and \\nNorthwestern\\'s guarantee. He needs to understand from a legal perspective how \\nthese will be provided to GE (i.e. if both ENA and NW will issue stand alone \\nguarantees). I told him that ENA will guarantee the remaining currently \\nscheduled payment obligations under the contract. He is also awaiting receipt \\nof the letter you\\'re putting together.\\n\\nPlease let me know how we should proceed.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenWhy didn\\'t we have the following language in the tax payment section:\\n=01;\\n.=01; \"In no event shall Payments in Lieu of Taxes include, apply to, or be=\\n=20\\nrequired to be made for Real Property Assets and/or Tangible Personal=20\\nProperty exempt under Florida Statutes in existence as of the Effective Dat=\\ne=20\\nor any date prior to commencement of operations of the proposed Facility, a=\\ns=20\\nsuch statutes may be amended from time to time.\"\\n=01;\\nSomehow this was missed because we didn\\'t follow the Pompano form closely=\\n=20\\nenough...=01;\\n(d) In the event of a termination as provided herein, the City and PBEC shall \\nbe relieved of all obligations hereunder and shall unconditionally execute \\nand record an instrument in the Public Records of Broward County, Florida, \\nreleasing each other from all obligations hereunder.Thanks much for the comments. Here\\'s my preliminary response:\\n\\n1. Done, and will add a definition of Effective Date\\n2. Will propose change to city.\\n3. OK - done.\\n4. Power plants are normally deemed to be factories for this purpose.\\n5. They promise to send us each a card and fruit cake each Christmas (just \\nkidding). Your point is understood, but this is a small commercial point \\nrelative to the overall deal.\\n6. Will propose change to city.\\n7. Ties to definition of Effective Date, which we will propose as requiring \\nthe passage of a resolution.\\n8. Sections will be added.\\n\\nI\\'ll send you the redraft as soon as we get it. Thanks again.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nI spoke to Dave, and he\\'s on board with us signing the agreement. We will \\nneed to have an i-DASH signed prior to the guarantee being issued. He wants \\nus to make sure that the termination section is adequate such that if we want \\nto terminate the agreement prior to the payment becoming due, that we will be \\nrelieved of our obligation to make the payment. I think the agreement does \\nthat (although it\\'s not the best language), and Debbie is adding some \\nlanguage to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep \\n(I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran \\nwants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination \\nsection is sufficient to relieve us from obligations under the agreement to \\nthe extent we terminate prior to the date upon which those obligations arise.\\n\\nWe can talk about this tomorrow. Debbie would like to have a conference call \\nat 10 AM central if you\\'re available.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenPlease see the attached document. \\n\\nWith respect to a call on Monday to discuss the attached, please advise us \\nwhat time in the afternoon works for you.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\nMy comments are attached.\\n\\n\\n\\n My revisions.

We\\'ll send the letter out today.\\n\\nRegards,\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173Kay:\\n\\nI didn\\'t get a chance to send the letter out today, but will do so tomorrow. Is it OK for me to send it out to AES without your initials, but with you intialing the copy we retain for our records? In the past, we typically provided payment direction to AES by e-mail.\\n\\nLet me know.\\n\\nYou\\'re so sharp.

Are you at your desk?\\n\\n\\nThanks, and hope you have a good holiday as well...\\n\\n\\nThese invoices are approved. Thanks.\\n\\n Please keep in mind that because of how the Developer\\'s Agreement is structured (i.e. it\\'s an \"option\" because we must first apply for a building permit to trigger the payment), there is no current payment obligation under the ENA guarantee. I also recollect that the ENA guarantee is a payment guarantee only.\\n\\n\\nWe assigned the agreement to Onondaga Energy Venture some time ago, so I would presume that matters pertaining to ENA no longer apply. Any thoughts on this? Also, if ENA still applies, I would presume ENA\\'s bankruptcy filing would protect against any such termination.\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173I sense the need for an all hands call tomorrow to discuss this.

How about 1 PM central?\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173I think we can skip the Thompson site since we only did it as an accomodation (it\\'s not the primary site). I don\\'t think we can justify paying Mancini. We\\'ll need to try to negotiate some sort of free extension. In any case, by the time Mancini\\'s due, we should have expressions of interest from prospective buyers. At that time, if we need to pay the option renewal premium (and we can\\'t negotiate an extension from Mancini) we can pay the option premium.\\n--------------------------\\nBen Jacoby\\n(713) 853-6173When do you think the payment\\'s due?\\n\\n\\nFolks:\\n\\nCan we get together at 3 PM in ECS to talk about the D5A.

I previously told him that because of timing \\nconsiderations and because there may be certain agreements that will be \\ndifficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect \\nagreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this \\nproject.\\n\\nI think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should \\nhave more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO \\non their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your \\nschedules on Friday?\\n\\nI also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the \\nMOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky \\nAlex. I would prefer the afternoon if that\\'s OK with you guys, and would like \\n45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise \\non the status of the tolling agreement.\\n\\nKay - attached is FPL\\'s standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking \\nthat Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working \\nwith accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be \\nfamiliar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will \\nbe important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues \\nrelated to this agreement on Friday. \\n\\nHope you both had good weekends. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\nAttached are my comments on the Midway LOI.\\n\\nFYI, Duran and I spoke to Mike Carlson of TECO regarding Ft. Pierce. Dave \\nreally wants us to push to get something done on that project. It would be \\nsimilarly styled to our Midway - TECO discussions (ENA sells the dev, asset \\nand takes back a 5 year toll). \\n\\nMike Carlson said he would get his lawyer to generate a LOI on Ft.Pierce, but \\nI think we need to get them comments back on Midway to expedite this.\\n\\nKay - have you had any luck engaging King & Spaulding on these deals?\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about these comments at your earliest convenience.\\n\\nFred - we need the term sheet on the toll, and the toll price refreshed by \\nthe desk, as soon as possible.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\nDave:\\n\\nThanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message \\ncorrectly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can \\noperate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas \\nemissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our \\noperating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at \\n100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nIn a seperate e-mail, I sent out the LOI to TECO which incorporated most of \\nFred\\'s comments. On the tolling term sheet, I agree with Fred\\'s comments. Kay \\n- where do we stand on having outside counsel review this? I have indicated \\nto TECO that we will have a draft tolling term sheet to them by Wednesday. \\nPlease let me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\nBecky:\\n\\nIn response to the second point below, the substation will be owned by FPL. \\nWe do not view that as a result of interconnection that there would be any \\nliabilities with respect to the FPL system. I would definately like for you \\nto have your legal counsel review the agreement, however, on this point, and \\nwould like any other legal / commercial comments at your earliest \\nconveneince. We plan to meet with FPL early next week on this agreement, and \\nwould of course like to incorporate TECO\\'s comments as well.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\nSee attached letter which was sent today to Navigant.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\nFred:\\n\\nI would like you to take a first shot at incorporating the terms we discussed \\ntoday and in Tampa with TECO.

Pierce Utility Authority.\\n\\n TECO.\\n\\n Do you want to send the LOI to TECO, or should I?\\n\\n We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% \\nprobability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have \\nprojects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and \\nLouisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. \\nThe non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and \\nflip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and \\nhave received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of \\nHartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).\\n\\nI would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of \\'02 if \\nwe do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is \\napproximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium \\nbeing offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we \\nhave a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with \\nany of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for \\n7FAs, although not all permits have been received).\\n\\n Have we asked John to turn this around by Monday?\\n\\n 11 AM EST works for me.\\n\\n Can we assume this will also cover Ft. Pierce?\\n\\n Anytime after 8 AM Pacific works for me.\\n\\n Thanks.\\n\\n I think we decided to take the turbine purchase approval route, and describe \\nthe several projects (Midway et al) that we can match the turbines with. Are \\nyou still OK with that?\\n\\n By Tuesday of next week or sooner if your schedule permits.\\n\\n I\\'ve been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest \\nby Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating \\nthat the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we \\nshould be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will \\nneed to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if \\nour number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but \\nI think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, \\n2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. \\n\\nThe group\\'s thoughts on this would be appreciated.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n My understanding is no - the actual site plan (i.e. layout, etc.) was \\napproved pursuant to a development order (aka the site plan approval order).\\n\\n One other item - we attempted to incorporate all the lessons learned from \\nearlier work on the Pompano Developer\\'s Agreement. I hope the attached is not \\ntoo painful.\\n\\nThanks for your help.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Attached are my comments on Fred\\'s draft of earlier this evening.\\nAll:\\n\\nFYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold \\nby Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe\\'s advisor regarding the \\ntransaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I \\nhave a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.\\n\\nFrom an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should \\nproceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the \\ncontracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a \\nrevised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now \\nand then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should \\nproceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I\\'m told three other \\nbidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.\\n\\nChip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH \\ntogether.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I \\nreceive them.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen \\n\\n Ad valorems do not necessarily decrease as a result of depreciation, because \\nmillage rates and a current years reassessment also are part of the \\ncalculation. \\n\\nHave they asked for this?\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nI added some language to the intro of section 1 a that worked last time with \\nHerman. Please disregard the earlier Pompano agreement. Let me know what you \\nthink.\\n\\n\\n\\n Steve:\\n\\nI have forwarded my comments on the Pompano agreement to Kay, and plan to \\nfollow up with her tomorrow. A commercial point that no one has raised with \\nme is the escalation on the $650k payment. I am not in favor of this. Where \\ndid this come from? Please advise.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n Kay:\\n\\nAttached are my changes to the Pompano Agreement. I reviewed the last version \\ndated 4-19 which was approved internally (copy also attached), and made \\nchanges back to that draft where I felt appropriate.\\n\\nThe only section I did not add back in was the termination section. From a \\ncommercial perspective, I think we\\'re better off leaving it out as we then \\nhave in effect a free option on the site (as a developers agreement is \\nrequired to obtain building permits). \\n\\nPlease let me know what you think.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n                      All:\\n\\nPlease make sure you review the attached editorial and voice any and all \\ncomments today.

She still hasn\\'t signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she \\nis not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary \\nfor the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  \\n\\nI did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my \\nschedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed \\nmeeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before \\nThursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting \\nwith the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are \\ntheir availabilities?\\n\\nConcerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire \\nshipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or \\nthe broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess \\nsomeone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is \\nnot a \"replacement cost value\"  policy nor an \"actual cash value\" policy, but \\na \"valued\" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the \\nvalue to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 \\nis the \"value\" of the generator.\\n\\nI await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it!

I\\'ve addressed this to both of you as \\nsome of my questions are based on the interaction of the PPA vs. development \\ntimeline and risk. Here are my thoughts / comments:\\n\\n1. The PPA is really a free option through Nov. 30th, at which time we can \\nchoose to exercise our position and proceed. How does this fit with our \\nexpectations regarding PUC approval of our CPCN (which seems to be our \\nhighest risk development item)? Have we gone back and submitted a \\nmodification to our CPCN for the 2- LM6000, and 1- SW501D5A config? \\n\\n2. Do we need to define the Facility as \"dual\" fuel? It will not initially be \\ndual fuelled as we intend to field engineer the dual fuel capability.\\n\\n3. Section 3.1 (c). This provision should acknowledge our right to sell base \\nContract Capacity (as opposed to excess) to any Person to the extent that \\nVEPCO has not exercised their option to purchase such Contract Capacity. In \\nother words, this section should be consistent with sales allowances to other \\nPersons in Section 3.4 (b) (although that section only references energy \\nsales).\\n\\n4. Section 3.4. Can we sell both day ahead energy and capacity to any Person \\nto the extent VEPCO does not exercise their call by providing us the notice \\ncontemplated in Section 3.4 (b) (the section only references an allowance for \\nenergy sales)?\\n\\n5. Section 3.4(c) Do the \"additional costs\" which this section requires Buyer \\nto pay (to the extent Buyer provides an intra-day notice) include \\n\"lost-profit\" costs arising from sales of energy and capacity by Seller to \\nother Persons as permitted in Section 3.4 (b)? If so, I would suggest that \\nthis section make a specific reference, such as \"including any and all of \\nSeller\\'s lost-profit and transaction costs associated with energy and \\ncapacity sales to other Persons\".\\n\\n6. Do we have a project LLC formed which can serve as the entity signing the \\nPPA? Do we think VEPCO will ask for any corp. or ENA guarantees to the extent \\nwe use an LLC?\\n\\n 7. Have we worked with the accountants to make sure we can use MTM \\naccounting given the terms of this PPA?  \\n\\nJeff: Please provide a brief development summary to the group outlining (in \\norder of highest risk to lowest) the various significant development items \\nwe\\'ll need to deal with for this site (i.e. zoning, groundwater supply vs. \\nmunicipal water supply, etc.).
